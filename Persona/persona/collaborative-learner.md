Profile
-------
The Collaborative Learner thrives on peer interaction, discussion, and co-construction of knowledge. They learn effectively in group tasks and using social scaffolds that structure interactions and provide roles.

Goals
-----
- Co-create solutions with peers and learn from diverse perspectives.
- Develop communication and negotiation skills.

Challenges
----------
- Group dynamics can cause social loafing, conflict, or domination by stronger members.
- Coordination costs and uneven contributions.

Preferred Scaffolds
-------------------
- Role-based prompts and turn-taking scaffolds
- Comparison & Exemplars for shared calibration
- Peer-feedback structures with rubrics

ADP Mapping (For / Against)
---------------------------
- Role Assignment
  - Concrete scaffold: Assign rotating roles (summariser, questioner, recorder) with prompts.
  - Why apply: Reduces social loafing and clarifies contributions.
  - Why not: Over-structuring can feel artificial; allow role negotiation.

- Peer Feedback Templates
  - Concrete scaffold: Guided peer review forms with sentence-starters.
  - Why apply: Improves feedback quality and reduces affective risk.
  - Why not: Templates may feel constraining; combine with free-text.

- Transparency & Control
  - Concrete scaffold: Show contribution logs and let teams shape norms.
  - Why apply: Encourages accountability and supports fairness.
  - Why not: May increase anxiety; present aggregated views first.

Interaction Example
-------------------
System: "Team roles: Alice (summariser), Bilal (questioner), Casey (recorder). Alice — summarise your plan in 2 lines."
Alice: "We’ll map causes, then propose two interventions."
System: "Great — Bilal, list two clarifying questions."

Research Questions
------------------
1. Do role-based ADPs reduce unequal participation and improve group product quality?
2. How does anonymised peer feedback affect perceived safety and feedback helpfulness?
3. Which contribution visualisations best support equitable collaboration without increasing anxiety?

Data & Validation Measures
--------------------------
- Contribution logs: edits, messages, time-on-task per member.
- Quality assessments of collaborative artifacts by blind raters.
- Surveys on perceived fairness, belonging, and psychological safety.

Implementation Notes
--------------------
- Provide both structured templates and open channels for feedback.
- Allow teams to customise role names and rotate frequency.
