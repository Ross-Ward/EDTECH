Profile
-------
Students engaged in semester-long CS/SE projects who must coordinate requirements, code, testing, and delivery. They need scaffolds for planning, version control practices, and realistic QA workflows.

Goals
-----
- Deliver working software to specification and on schedule.
- Learn team engineering practices (Git, CI, testing, deployment basics).

Challenges
----------
- Coordination overhead, merge conflicts, and uneven skill distribution in teams.
- Difficulty prioritising technical debt versus feature completion.

Preferred Scaffolds
-------------------
- Project milestone prompts and lightweight CI feedback integration
- Role suggestions and contribution visualisations
- Automated test hints and failing-test triage support

ADP Mapping (For / Against)
---------------------------
- Milestone Prompts & Triage
  - Concrete scaffold: Recommend milestone breakdowns, acceptance criteria, and quick triage checklists for failing builds.
  - Why apply: Structures team work and reduces scope creep.
  - Why not: Overly rigid milestones can reduce responsiveness to discovery; keep them editable.

- Version-Control Support (conflict helpers)
  - Concrete scaffold: When merge conflicts are detected, provide suggested resolutions and explain common conflict patterns.
  - Why apply: Lowers friction of collaboration and teaches best practices.
  - Why not: Automated merges risk masking deeper design mismatches; present suggestions, not forced fixes.

- Lightweight CI Feedback
  - Concrete scaffold: Surface failing test info with clear links to relevant code and suggested next steps.
  - Why apply: Rapid feedback shortens failure-to-fix cycles and teaches test-driven workflows.
  - Why not: Noisy CI can be demotivating; support flake detection and noise reduction.

Interaction Example
-------------------
System: "CI failed: 3 tests. Suggested next step: run failing tests locally, open an issue with stack traces, tag teammate for review. Create issue? [Yes / No]"

Research Questions
------------------
1. Do lightweight CI insights and triage suggestions reduce mean time-to-fix in student projects?
2. How do visual contribution dashboards affect perceived fairness and workload distribution?
3. What scaffolds help students meaningfully balance feature work and technical debt?

Data & Validation Measures
--------------------------
- Build failure frequency, time-to-fix, and issue creation patterns.
- Contribution distribution and merge conflict incidence.
- Project rubric scores from instructors and peer-evaluations.

Implementation Notes
--------------------
- Integrate with common student Git workflows and allow instructors to configure CI sensitivity.
- Keep autogenerated merge suggestions as advisories, not automatic resolutions.
