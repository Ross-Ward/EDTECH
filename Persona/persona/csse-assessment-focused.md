Profile
-------
Students who prioritise performing well on assignments and exams. They respond to clear grading criteria and targeted practice aligned with assessment templates.

Goals
-----
- Maximise grades through targeted practice and rubric-aligned work.
- Efficiently prepare for exams and timed assessments.

Challenges
----------
- Overfitting to past exam formats and neglecting deeper understanding.
- Anxiety in timed, high-stakes assessments.

Preferred Scaffolds
-------------------
- Rubric-aligned micro-practice and formative autograder runs
- Timed practice simulations and scaffolded exam-like problems
- Feedback linking solutions to rubric items

ADP Mapping (For / Against)
---------------------------
- Rubric-Aligned Feedback
  - Concrete scaffold: After submission, show which rubric items were met and which were not, with examples.
  - Why apply: Makes improvement targeted and efficient.
  - Why not: Risk of surface-level optimization; pair with conceptual checks.

- Timed Practice Simulators
  - Concrete scaffold: Simulate exam conditions with optional low-stakes practice sessions.
  - Why apply: Reduces test anxiety via rehearsal.
  - Why not: Repeated simulation without reflection may foster rote strategies.

- Formative Autograder Runs
  - Concrete scaffold: Allow limited private autograder runs with explanations before formal submission.
  - Why apply: Rapid iteration and learning from errors.
  - Why not: If unlimited, promotes trial-and-error; limit runs and require reflection after multiple attempts.

Interaction Example
-------------------
System: "Run a timed practice (45 min) simulating Exam A? This will save your submission privately for reflection. Start? [Yes / No]"

Research Questions
------------------
1. Do rubric-aligned micro-practice tasks improve rubric-relevant performance without reducing conceptual depth?
2. What is the optimal limit of formative autograder runs to maximise learning while minimising trials-for-points behaviour?
3. How effective are timed practice simulators at reducing exam anxiety and improving performance?

Data & Validation Measures
--------------------------
- Autograder run counts, rubric-item pass rates, timed-practice uptake.
- Correlation between practice behaviours and final assessment performance.
- Anxiety and preparedness self-reports pre/post simulation.

Implementation Notes
--------------------
- Limit formative autograder runs and require brief reflections after repeated attempts.
- Design rubric feedback to emphasise conceptual improvements as well as checklist items.
