Profile
-------
The Strategic Learner focuses on efficient learning and performance. They set clear goals, adjust strategies, and prioritise tasks with an aim to optimise outcomes under constraints (time, assessment weight).

Goals
-----
- Maximise performance on graded tasks with efficient study strategies.
- Build reusable strategies for future problem-solving.

Challenges
----------
- Can over-prioritise efficiency at the expense of deeper learning.
- May ignore scaffolds perceived as time-consuming or low-return.

Preferred Scaffolds
-------------------
- Goal Setting ADPs with editable micro-goals
- Adaptive Sequencing to optimise practice order
- Progress Prompts tied to assessment criteria

ADP Mapping (For / Against)
---------------------------
- Goal Setting
  - Concrete scaffold: Guided SMART goal setup before tasks.
  - Why apply: Encourages intentional planning and aligns activity with assessment metrics.
  - Why not: Rigid goal templates can feel constraining; allow customisation.

- Adaptive Sequencing
  - Concrete scaffold: Reorder practice items to focus on weak concepts.
  - Why apply: Efficiently targets gaps and accelerates mastery.
  - Why not: May reduce desirable difficulty if sequencing becomes too easy.

- Feedback with Explanations
  - Concrete scaffold: Provide actionable, targeted feedback linked to rubric.
  - Why apply: Rapidly improves performance and strategy refinement.
  - Why not: Overly prescriptive feedback can reduce self-assessment behaviours.

Interaction Example
-------------------
System: "Set a SMART goal for this session (30 minutes): what will you complete?"
Learner: "Finish practice set 3 and correct two past mistakes using worked examples."
System: "Adaptive plan: start with the 2 past mistakes, then practice set 3 (estimated 22 min). Proceed? [Yes / Edit]"

Research Questions
------------------
1. Does Adaptive Sequencing reduce time-to-mastery versus fixed sequencing for strategic learners?
2. How does editable goal-setting influence transfer of strategies to novel tasks?
3. What balance of feedback specificity maximises strategic refinement while preserving self-evaluation?

Data & Validation Measures
--------------------------
- Time-on-task and task-order logs.
- Performance curves across sequenced practice items.
- Goal adherence metrics (goal set vs completed) and post-task reflection.

Implementation Notes
--------------------
- Allow easy editing of goals and sequencing rules.
- Provide control to disable aggressive adaptations.
