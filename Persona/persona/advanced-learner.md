Profile
-------
The Advanced Learner has strong domain knowledge and seeks challenging, open-ended tasks. They value autonomy, minimal hand-holding, and opportunities for deep exploration.

Goals
-----
- Engage with complex, authentic problems that promote transfer.
- Refine and extend existing expertise through adaptive challenge.

Challenges
----------
- May find basic scaffolds patronising or time-wasting.
- Requires tasks that sustain productive struggle and novelty.

Preferred Scaffolds
-------------------
- Optional adaptive challenges and enrichment pathways
- Transparency controls to tune scaffold aggressiveness
- Peer-calibration and advanced exemplars

ADP Mapping (For / Against)
---------------------------
- Adaptive Challenge Scaling
  - Concrete scaffold: Offer optional harder variants of tasks and unseen contexts.
  - Why apply: Supports continued growth and transfer.
  - Why not: May increase frustration if gaps in foundational knowledge exist.

- Transparency & Control
  - Concrete scaffold: Let users toggle hint levels, exemplar visibility, and scaffolding frequency.
  - Why apply: Preserves autonomy and avoids undermining expert strategies.
  - Why not: Too much configuration may be burdensome; offer sensible presets.

- Research-Style Prompts
  - Concrete scaffold: Pose open-ended research questions, encourage external resources and citation.
  - Why apply: Encourages scholarly depth and synthesis.
  - Why not: Not suitable for time-pressured contexts.

Interaction Example
-------------------
System: "Would you like an advanced variant of this task that requires transfer across two domains? [Yes / No]"
Learner: "Yes — include no hints, but give a 30-second direction-setting prompt."

Research Questions
------------------
1. Do optional advanced pathways increase retention and transfer among advanced learners?
2. How does scaffold transparency affect use of hints and overall performance?
3. Does scaffolding that supports external-resource integration improve scholarly artefact quality?

Data & Validation Measures
--------------------------
- Choice logs (advanced vs standard tasks), completion and success rates.
- Performance on transfer tasks and peer-reviewed artefacts.
- Surveys on perceived autonomy and cognitive engagement.

Implementation Notes
--------------------
- Provide sensible presets and an easy reset to default behavior.
- Ensure advanced tasks are curated and validated for appropriate challenge.
