Profile
-------
The Distracted Learner struggles with sustained attention and is easily pulled away by notifications, environment, or multitasking. They benefit from micro-scaffolds that reduce friction and reorient focus.

Goals
-----
- Complete tasks with minimal interruption.
- Build routines for focused study and gradual skill growth.

Challenges
----------
- Frequent context switches and shallow task engagement.
- Frustration with long tasks and low tolerance for delay.

Preferred Scaffolds
-------------------
- Just-in-Time Scaffolds and Nudges
- Timers / Pomodoro-style micro-sessions
- Minimal, low-friction adaptive hints

ADP Mapping (For / Against)
---------------------------
- Just-in-Time Scaffolds
  - Concrete scaffold: When off-task patterns are detected, present a brief reorientation prompt and optional 5-minute focus mode.
  - Why apply: Lowers barrier to resume and respects short attention spans.
  - Why not: Poorly-timed nudges may irritate or be ignored; ensure predictive accuracy.

- Choice Architecture (small options)
  - Concrete scaffold: Offer two short study paths (quick practice vs deep dive).
  - Why apply: Reduces decision paralysis and matches attention window.
  - Why not: Too many choices will worsen distraction.

- Notification Dampening (system-level)
  - Concrete scaffold: Suggest turning on a temporary 'focus mode' integrated with device settings.
  - Why apply: Reduces external distractors.
  - Why not: Requires integration with OS or user action; may be resisted.

Interaction Example
-------------------
System: "I noticed a pause >3 minutes—quick reset: pick (A) 10-minute focused task or (B) save and schedule later."
Learner: "A"
System: "Starting a 10-min timer. I'll mute non-essential alerts and show one micro-problem. Ready?"

Research Questions
------------------
1. Do micro-session scaffolds (5–15 min) improve completion rates for distracted learners?
2. How accurate must off-task detection be to yield net engagement benefits vs false interruptions?
3. Does offering two-choice study paths reduce decision time and improve initiation rates?

Data & Validation Measures
--------------------------
- Window focus/activity logs, pause durations, and response to nudges.
- Completion rates for micro-sessions vs full sessions.
- Self-report interruption frequency and perceived usefulness of nudges.

Implementation Notes
--------------------
- Prioritise non-intrusive, opt-in nudges.
- Provide clear privacy notice for attention detection features.
