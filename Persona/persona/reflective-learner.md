Profile
-------
The Reflective Learner is intrinsically motivated, enjoys writing and synthesising ideas, and regularly engages in self-evaluation. They prefer slow, scaffolded reflection opportunities that help them consolidate learning and link tasks to broader goals.

Goals
-----
- Develop deeper conceptual understanding rather than rote performance.
- Improve metacognitive skills: planning, monitoring, and reflection.
- Produce high-quality artifacts and reflective summaries for assignments.

Challenges
----------
- Tends to over-reflect and can get bogged down in details, reducing forward progress.
- May require prompts to link reflection to concrete next steps.
- Higher cognitive load if scaffolds are too verbose or untimely.

Preferred Scaffolds
-------------------
- Reflection Prompts (timed and end-of-task)
- Progress Prompts with explicit next-step suggestions
- Structured journaling templates and rubrics

ADP Mapping (For / Against)
---------------------------
- Reflection Prompts
  - Concrete scaffold: At task completion provide a 3-question reflection scaffold (What worked? What didn’t? What next?).
  - Why apply: Directly supports metacognitive reflection and articulation of strategies, improving transfer.
  - Why not: Overuse may increase time-on-task and reduce motivation; needs frequency controls.

- Progress Prompts
  - Concrete scaffold: Periodic summaries of progress with suggested micro-goals.
  - Why apply: Keeps reflective insights actionable (bridges reflection → planning).
  - Why not: Can feel prescriptive; should be optional and configurable.

- Adaptive Hints (low-frequency)
  - Concrete scaffold: Provide hints only when the learner requests or after observable stagnation.
  - Why apply: Preserves agency while preventing rumination.
  - Why not: Aggressive hinting undermines independent reflection.

- Peer Comparison (cautious)
  - Concrete scaffold: Anonymous exemplar artifacts for benchmarking.
  - Why apply: Helps calibrate self-evaluation.
  - Why not: May demotivate if used without supportive framing or if learner is sensitive to social comparison.

Interaction Example
-------------------
System: "You’ve completed the draft. Quick reflection: (1) What was your strongest decision? (2) What would you change next time? (3) One micro-step to move forward?"
Learner: "My strongest decision was structuring the argument; I’d add more examples next time; next micro-step: outline two supporting examples."
System: "Great — add ‘outline two examples’ to your to-do list and set a 20-minute timer. Would you like an exemplar of high-quality examples? [Yes / No]"

Research Questions
------------------
1. Does brief structured reflection after tasks increase transfer to subsequent tasks compared to no reflection?
2. What frequency of Progress Prompts maximizes application of reflection into actionable planning without increasing cognitive load?
3. How does optional exemplar exposure affect calibration of self-evaluation and confidence?

Data & Validation Measures
--------------------------
- Interaction logs: reflection prompt responses, timestamps, whether exemplar requested.
- SRL questionnaires (pre/post): metacognitive awareness inventory.
- Task performance: improvement on subsequent assignments, transfer tasks.
- Qualitative reflections: thematic analysis of free-text reflection to measure depth and strategy use.

Implementation Notes
--------------------
- Provide opt-out and frequency controls for prompts.
- Keep reflection prompts concise and scaffolded to reduce cognitive load.
- Log responses securely and anonymize exemplars.
