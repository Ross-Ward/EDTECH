Profile
-------
This persona represents learners who act as mentors — they already exhibit strong self-regulation and scaffold peers. They benefit from tools that let them author scaffolds and reflect on mentoring strategies.

Goals
-----
- Support peers effectively while consolidating their own learning.
- Develop coaching strategies and meta-level awareness of scaffolding.

Challenges
----------
- Risk of overfitting advice to their own style.
- Managing cognitive load when balancing mentoring and personal tasks.

Preferred Scaffolds
-------------------
- Scaffolding Authoring Tools (templates & analytics)
- Reflection + Feedback about mentoring impact
- Shared dashboards for mentee progress

ADP Mapping (For / Against)
---------------------------
- Scaffolding Authoring
  - Concrete scaffold: Templates for creating reflection prompts, hints, and rubrics for mentees.
  - Why apply: Amplifies mentor impact and creates reusable scaffolds.
  - Why not: Templates that are too prescriptive can reduce mentor creativity.

- Analytics & Feedback
  - Concrete scaffold: Show mentors anonymised metrics of mentee engagement and improvement.
  - Why apply: Enables data-informed mentoring and adjustment.
  - Why not: Must preserve mentee privacy and avoid public ranking.

- Reflection Prompts (meta)
  - Concrete scaffold: Periodic prompts asking mentors what worked and what to change.
  - Why apply: Supports continuous pedagogical improvement for mentors.
  - Why not: If too frequent, it creates administrative overhead.

Interaction Example
-------------------
Mentor: "I’ll add a hint template for step 3."
System: "Template saved. Would you like to apply it to similar tasks and receive weekly anonymised impact metrics? [Yes / No]"

Research Questions
------------------
1. Does authoring scaffolds improve mentors’ own mastery and pedagogical knowledge?
2. What analytics are most useful for mentors to adjust scaffolds without compromising privacy?
3. How does scaffold reuse across mentees affect outcomes and mentor workload?

Data & Validation Measures
--------------------------
- Scaffold deployment logs and mentee uptake.
- Mentee performance trajectories tied to scaffold exposure (anonymised).
- Mentor self-reports and reflection depth metrics.

Implementation Notes
--------------------
- Provide easy scaffold templates and an opt-in analytics dashboard.
- Implement privacy-preserving aggregation for mentee metrics.
