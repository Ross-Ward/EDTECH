Profile
-------
The Novice Learner is new to a domain and requires clear, low-stakes scaffolds to build foundational knowledge and confidence. They benefit from progressive disclosure and worked examples.

Goals
-----
- Acquire core concepts and avoid early frustration.
- Build procedural fluency and confidence to attempt independent tasks.

Challenges
----------
- Overwhelm when presented with too much complexity.
- Tendency to give up when initial feedback is negative or ambiguous.

Preferred Scaffolds
-------------------
- Worked Examples and Step-by-Step Walkthroughs
- Graduated Difficulty (scaffold fading)
- Frequent low-stakes formative feedback

ADP Mapping (For / Against)
---------------------------
- Worked Examples
  - Concrete scaffold: Provide annotated examples that the learner can explore and then partially attempt.
  - Why apply: Reduces cognitive load and models expert problem-solving.
  - Why not: Overreliance may hinder generative practice; fade examples progressively.

- Adaptive Sequencing (easy→hard)
  - Concrete scaffold: Start with foundational items and progress automatically as mastery is detected.
  - Why apply: Builds fluency and confidence progressively.
  - Why not: Avoid making early steps trivially easy; include desirable difficulty.

- Immediate, formative feedback
  - Concrete scaffold: Small, actionable hints for common errors.
  - Why apply: Helps novices correct misconceptions early.
  - Why not: Overly specific feedback can become a crutch; combine with explanation.

Interaction Example
-------------------
System: "Try this worked example: step 1 — identify variable; step 2 — choose operation. Now try a similar problem; you can ask for a hint."

Research Questions
------------------
1. How does graduated fading of worked examples affect long-term retention for novices?
2. What balance of immediate feedback and problem difficulty best supports independent problem solving?
3. Which formative feedback formats (text, annotated example, short video) yield the largest gains in early mastery?

Data & Validation Measures
--------------------------
- Error taxonomy logs and hint-request frequency.
- Mastery checks and retention tests after delay.
- Self-efficacy surveys and confidence calibration measures.

Implementation Notes
--------------------
- Include progressive fading rules and configurable hint thresholds.
- Track hint dependence and design exercises that require generative steps.
