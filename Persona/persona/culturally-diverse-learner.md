Profile
-------
Learners from diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds who benefit from culturally responsive content, examples, and scaffolding that respects varied norms and prior knowledge.

Goals
-----
- Learn in ways that connect to their background knowledge and values.
- See materials and examples that are culturally relevant and inclusive.

Challenges
----------
- Examples and contexts that assume a dominant cultural frame can reduce relevance and engagement.
- Language barriers and different rhetorical norms can affect comprehension.

Preferred Scaffolds
-------------------
- Localised examples and optional language simplification
- Transparent explanations of normative expectations (e.g., citation norms)
- Choice of cultural framing for case studies

ADP Mapping (For / Against)
---------------------------
- Localised Examples
  - Concrete scaffold: Offer multiple culturally-framed examples for key concepts.
  - Why apply: Increases relevance and transfer by leveraging prior knowledge.
  - Why not: Risk of stereotyping; examples must be varied and vetted.

- Language Simplification & Translation
  - Concrete scaffold: Provide simplified summaries and optional translations.
  - Why apply: Reduces language barrier and improves comprehension.
  - Why not: Avoid flattening nuance; ensure translations are high-quality.

- Transparency of Norms
  - Concrete scaffold: Explain assessment expectations and rhetorical styles explicitly.
  - Why apply: Reduces hidden curriculum effects and cultural mismatch.
  - Why not: Over-explaining can feel patronising; tailor tone carefully.

Interaction Example
-------------------
System: "Choose context for this problem: (A) Local community case study or (B) International example. Which would you prefer?"

Research Questions
------------------
1. Does offering culturally-framed examples increase comprehension and problem transfer?
2. How does language simplification affect depth of understanding and nuance preservation?
3. Which transparency interventions best reduce hidden curriculum effects for underrepresented groups?

Data & Validation Measures
--------------------------
- Choice logs for example framing and language options.
- Performance disaggregated by chosen framing and background.
- Qualitative feedback on perceived cultural relevance and fairness.

Implementation Notes
--------------------
- Co-design examples with diverse stakeholders to avoid tokenism.
- Provide opt-in cultural framing rather than assuming defaults.
