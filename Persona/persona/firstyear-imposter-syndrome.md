Profile
-------
First-year students who struggle with feelings of inadequacy compared to peers, often attributing success to luck. This affects participation, help-seeking, and persistence in CS/SE foundational courses.

Goals
-----
- Build confidence and internalize a growth mindset about coding ability.
- Increase help-seeking and collaborative learning behaviours.

Challenges
----------
- Avoidance of public help-seeking due to fear of negative judgment.
- Quick discouragement after initial failures or comparing to peers.

Preferred Scaffolds
-------------------
- Strengths-based feedback and private practice modes
- Low-stakes mastery checks and progress visualisations
- Peer mentoring and normalising examples of struggle

ADP Mapping (For / Against)
---------------------------
- Strengths-Based Feedback
  - Concrete scaffold: Highlight two concrete successes before one area for improvement.
  - Why apply: Supports self-efficacy and reduces threat responses.
  - Why not: Must be specific to be authentic; avoid generic praise.

- Anonymised Peer Journeys
  - Concrete scaffold: Show anonymised timelines of peer progress to normalise early struggle.
  - Why apply: Reduces social comparison by demonstrating common difficulty trajectories.
  - Why not: Poorly presented timelines may still trigger negative comparison; accompany with growth narratives.

- Private Practice Mode
  - Concrete scaffold: Offer ungraded practice with targeted feedback only visible to the learner.
  - Why apply: Encourages experimentation without fear of exposure.
  - Why not: Need mechanisms to help transfer practice gains to graded contexts.

Interaction Example
-------------------
System: "Private practice mode active — try two micro-problems. After these, I’ll show progress compared to your last attempt. Ready?"

Research Questions
------------------
1. Do anonymised progress timelines reduce feelings of relative inadequacy and increase persistence?
2. What effect does strengths-first feedback have on help-seeking behaviour and participation?
3. How does private practice influence eventual performance on graded tasks?

Data & Validation Measures
--------------------------
- Uptake of private practice mode, subsequent help-seeking frequency.
- Self-report measures for imposter feelings and self-efficacy.
- Longitudinal submission and grade patterns.

Implementation Notes
--------------------
- Keep comparison data anonymised and accompanied by growth narratives.
- Make private practice easy to access and clearly labelled as ungraded.
