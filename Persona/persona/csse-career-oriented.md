Profile
-------
Students focused on building a portfolio, practical skills, and interview readiness. They seek scaffolds that translate course tasks into portfolio-worthy artifacts and practice common industry tasks.

Goals
-----
- Produce demonstrable projects and coding tasks for job applications.
- Practice coding interview problems and professional tooling.

Challenges
----------
- Balancing course requirements with portfolio-worthy work.
- Lack of clarity about industry expectations and how to present academic work.

Preferred Scaffolds
-------------------
- Portfolio conversion guides and templated README generators
- Interview-style micro-problems with timed whiteboard mode
- Guidance on professional practices (git hygiene, testing, documentation)

ADP Mapping (For / Against)
---------------------------
- Portfolio Conversion Scaffold
  - Concrete scaffold: Suggest packaging steps (README, screenshots, CI badge) to convert assignments into portfolio items.
  - Why apply: Lowers barrier to presenting work professionally and helps career outcomes.
  - Why not: Must respect course policies about open-sourcing assignments; include instructor permissions.

- Interview Micro-Practice
  - Concrete scaffold: Offer short, timed problems with feedback and hints styled like technical interviews.
  - Why apply: Builds familiarity with interview constraints and time pressure.
  - Why not: May increase anxiety; make optional with calming scaffolds.

- Professional Tooling Prompts
  - Concrete scaffold: Encourage small tasks such as adding tests or CI to projects, with templated steps.
  - Why apply: Teaches industry-relevant practices and improves code quality.
  - Why not: Time-consuming for students; provide quick starter templates.

Interaction Example
-------------------
System: "Would you like to generate a README and deploy a demo for this assignment (requires instructor opt-in)? [Yes / No]"

Research Questions
------------------
1. Does scaffolded conversion of assignment artifacts to portfolio items increase job application outcomes?
2. How does optional interview-style practice affect interview performance and confidence?
3. What minimal tooling scaffolds produce measurable improvements in code quality accepted by recruiters?

Data & Validation Measures
--------------------------
- Uptake of portfolio conversion features and number of public demos created (with permission).
- Performance metrics on timed micro-problems and self-reported interview readiness.
- Quality indicators such as tests added, documentation completeness, and recruiter feedback (if available).

Implementation Notes
--------------------
- Respect academic integrity and provide instructor opt-in for public artefact publication.
- Provide quick templates to reduce student overhead.
