Profile
-------
Learners with sensory, motor, cognitive, or neurodiverse needs who require accessible interfaces and flexible scaffolds. They benefit from multimodal content and adjustable pacing.

Goals
-----
- Engage with content comfortably, with accommodations preserved.
- Demonstrate competency using accessible modalities and supports.

Challenges
----------
- Standard interaction patterns and pacing can exclude or frustrate these learners.
- Accessibility needs are heterogeneous and require customization.

Preferred Scaffolds
-------------------
- Multimodal content (audio, text, captions)
- Adjustable pacing, font sizes, and interaction complexity
- Predictable UI and scaffolding with clear affordances

ADP Mapping (For / Against)
---------------------------
- Multimodal Scaffolds
  - Concrete scaffold: Offer audio narration, captions, and text simplification toggles.
  - Why apply: Supports different sensory and cognitive processing needs.
  - Why not: Must avoid duplicative clutter; provide clear toggle controls.

- Adjustable Pacing & Control
  - Concrete scaffold: Let learners control hint timing, auto-advance, and session speed.
  - Why apply: Preserves agency and reduces cognitive load.
  - Why not: Too many options can overwhelm; group sensible presets (e.g., ‘high support’, ‘moderate’, ‘low’).

- Predictability & Minimal Surprise
  - Concrete scaffold: Keep interaction patterns consistent and provide advance notice of scaffold actions.
  - Why apply: Reduces cognitive load and stress for neurodiverse learners.
  - Why not: May feel less dynamic; ensure balance.

Interaction Example
-------------------
System: "I can read this passage aloud and highlight text as I speak. Would you like narration on? [On / Off]"

Research Questions
------------------
1. How do multimodal scaffolds affect comprehension and retention across different accessibility needs?
2. What presets (high/medium/low support) best match commonly observed accommodation profiles?
3. Does predictable scaffold behaviour improve engagement and reduce cognitive load for neurodiverse learners?

Data & Validation Measures
--------------------------
- Accessibility setting usage logs (narration, captions, font size).
- Comprehension and retention measures across modalities.
- Usability testing and qualitative feedback from targeted user groups.

Implementation Notes
--------------------
- Follow WCAG guidelines and support ARIA roles for UI components.
- Provide quick presets and an accessibility onboarding flow.
- Involve users with lived experience in iterative testing.
