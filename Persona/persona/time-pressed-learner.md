Profile
-------
Learners with significant external commitments (work, family) who need high-impact learning in constrained time windows. They require highly efficient scaffolds and clear triage of content.

Goals
-----
- Obtain maximal learning gain from limited study time.
- Maintain steady progress with minimal setup overhead.

Challenges
----------
- Limited availability and high cognitive load due to multitasking.
- Difficulty scheduling larger blocks for deep work.

Preferred Scaffolds
-------------------
- Microlearning modules and concise practice
- Prioritisation aids and progress nudges
- Flexible scheduling & catch-up summaries

ADP Mapping (For / Against)
---------------------------
- Microlearning
  - Concrete scaffold: 5–15 minute focused activities with clear learning objectives.
  - Why apply: Matches attention and availability constraints, facilitates frequent retrieval practice.
  - Why not: Risk of fragmented knowledge without integrative tasks; include synthesis prompts.

- Prioritisation Prompts
  - Concrete scaffold: Suggest the highest-impact next task based on remaining time.
  - Why apply: Reduces decision overhead and increases productive use of small windows.
  - Why not: May sometimes deprioritise deep learning unless explicitly scheduled.

- Catch-up Summaries
  - Concrete scaffold: Provide concise recap of previous session and one quick question to reorient.
  - Why apply: Lowers resumption cost and preserves continuity.
  - Why not: If too long, defeats the purpose; keep one-sentence and one-question.

Interaction Example
-------------------
System: "You have 12 minutes — suggested: 1 quick retrieval quiz (6 min) + 1 application micro-task (5 min). Start?"

Research Questions
------------------
1. Do microlearning sequences with scheduled catch-up summaries improve longitudinal retention compared to ad-hoc short sessions?
2. How accurate are prioritisation prompts at suggesting high-impact tasks in constrained windows?
3. What is the minimal catch-up recap length that reliably restores context and reduces resumption time?

Data & Validation Measures
--------------------------
- Session length distribution, task selection, and completion rates.
- Retention tests and synthesis task performance over time.
- Resumption latency after breaks and perceived resumption ease.

Implementation Notes
--------------------
- Offer “quick start” presets and one-click session start.
- Maintain short, consistent recaps; measure their effectiveness and adapt.
