Profile
-------
The Anxious Learner experiences performance anxiety, fear of negative evaluation, or high stakes stress. They benefit from supportive scaffolds that reduce threat and increase psychological safety.

Goals
-----
- Complete tasks with reduced anxiety and build confidence.
- Learn strategies to manage stress in assessments.

Challenges
----------
- Avoidance of tasks perceived as risky or exposing.
- Over-worrying about peer comparison or mistakes.

Preferred Scaffolds
-------------------
- Low-stakes practice and private feedback
- Encouraging, strengths-based prompts
- Opt-in exemplar exposure and anonymised benchmarking

ADP Mapping (For / Against)
---------------------------
- Low-Stakes Practice
  - Concrete scaffold: Offer an ungraded practice mode with feedback and private review.
  - Why apply: Reduces threat and encourages experimentation.
  - Why not: Learners may not transfer practice behaviours to graded contexts without support.

- Strengths-Based Feedback
  - Concrete scaffold: Emphasise what the learner did well before corrective suggestions.
  - Why apply: Preserves motivation and reduces threat responses.
  - Why not: Must be genuine and specific; hollow praise is counterproductive.

- Anonymised Exemplars (cautious)
  - Concrete scaffold: Show anonymised high/low examples with constructive commentary.
  - Why apply: Offers standards without personal comparison.
  - Why not: Even anonymised comparison can increase anxiety for some; make optional.

Interaction Example
-------------------
System: "Try this practice version — ungraded, private. After completion I’ll highlight two strengths and one small improvement. Proceed? [Yes / No]"

Research Questions
------------------
1. Does low-stakes practice reduce avoidance and increase subsequent graded-task engagement?
2. How does strengths-first feedback impact anxiety levels and learning gains?
3. What opt-in controls are most effective to let anxious learners engage with exemplars safely?

Data & Validation Measures
--------------------------
- Uptake of practice mode and transitions to graded tasks.
- Self-reported anxiety before and after scaffold exposure (short validated scales).
- Quality of submissions and revision frequency following strengths-based feedback.

Implementation Notes
--------------------
- Make anxiety-related scaffolds opt-in and discrete.
- Respect privacy and avoid public leaderboards or direct comparisons.
