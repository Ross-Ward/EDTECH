Profile
-------
This learner struggles with initiating or sustaining effort due to low intrinsic motivation, external pressures, or competing commitments. They need scaffolds that increase relevance and short-term reward.

Goals
-----
- Find personally meaningful reasons to engage with tasks.
- Build momentum through small wins and visible progress.

Challenges
----------
- Low initiation, high procrastination, and rapid drop-off in engagement.
- May view scaffolds as manipulative if poorly framed.

Preferred Scaffolds
-------------------
- Choice Architecture for meaningful task selection
- Gamified micro-rewards and progress visualisations
- Social accountability (study buddy or light commitments)

ADP Mapping (For / Against)
---------------------------
- Choice Architecture
  - Concrete scaffold: Offer task choices labelled by outcome (e.g., ‘10-min quick win’ vs ‘30-min deep work’).
  - Why apply: Increases perceived autonomy and alignment with immediate preferences.
  - Why not: Too many choices dilute effect; present curated options.

- Gamification (micro-rewards)
  - Concrete scaffold: Badges, streaks, and micro-feedback for small achievements.
  - Why apply: Provides short-term motivation and visible progress.
  - Why not: Extrinsic rewards can decay intrinsic motivation if used alone; pair with relevance framing.

- Social Accountability
  - Concrete scaffold: Optional commit-to-peer feature with lightweight notifications.
  - Why apply: Leverages normative influence to increase initiation.
  - Why not: Avoid shaming; make it opt-in and private.

Interaction Example
-------------------
System: "Pick a starter: (A) 10-minute quick win (1 point) or (B) 25-minute deep session (3 points). Which one?"
Learner: "A"
System: "Nice — you earned 1 progress point. Want to schedule another 10-minute block? [Yes / No]"

Research Questions
------------------
1. Which gamified micro-rewards best increase initial uptake without undermining intrinsic motivation?
2. Does offering curated choice labels increase initiation and sustained engagement?
3. How does low-burden social accountability affect persistence for low-motivation learners?

Data & Validation Measures
--------------------------
- Uptake and retention of micro-session choices.
- Changes in initiation latency (time from assignment to first action).
- Self-reported motivation and perceived usefulness of micro-rewards.

Implementation Notes
--------------------
- Pair extrinsic rewards with meaning-making prompts to avoid undermining intrinsic interest.
- Allow full opt-out of social features.
