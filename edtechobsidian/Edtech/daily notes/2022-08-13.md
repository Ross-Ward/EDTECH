## Notes / Turn into Zettels

Using the concept of idea emergence to generate bottom-up ideas into a top-down hierarchy. In this case, **Emergence Level 1** is the individual note.

**Emergence Level 2** is a simple or complex zettelkasten in that notes are linked to one another.

**Emergence Level 3** are index notes or Maps of Content (MOCs).

**Emergence Level 4** are MOCs linked to other MOCs.

**Emergence Level 5** is the master note, or the main note. It consolidates higher-level notes onto one note.
