## Introduction

Thank you for downloading the Obsidian Starter Kit! This Readme file is both in PDF and Markdown. Open this .md version to jump in right away after install Obsidian on your desktop.

While you won't necessarily need to use all these templates, my hope for you is that this gives you a starting position into writing and developing your own notes and ideas.

Read the Markdown Quick Start Guide for a basic understanding of Markdown to jump into Obsidian right away.

For the extra bold, and those who work in a Windows Environment, try installing install Obsidian on your external device to take your notes wherever you go! Check out the [[How to Install Obsidian on External Device (Windows Only)]] notes, conveniently written in Markdown already.

For those new to Markdown, check out the [[Markdown Quick Start Guide]] to get an overview and examples of how the markup language works.

> **Note:** These wiki-links are clickable within Obsidian. If you're reading this on the PDF version, they won't work. But the following link to Obsidian down below will. ⬇️

With that being said, first thing's first:

1. Download [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) and install for your Windows, Mac, or Linux environment.
2. Launch Obsidian and head over to the left hand side (see below) and choose the first button on top to open your working directory. Hovering over it with your mouse will reveal *Open another vault* as the description.
3. Decide if you want to open an existing folder or create a new folder as a "vault." All a vault is is the folder where your Markdown files will be stored.

	- **Tip:** I'd recommend renaming the Obsidian Starter Kit folder and use that to *Open folder as vault* if you're just starting out. Play around with Obsidian and get familiar with this setting.

## Templates

These templates are yours to do with what you wish. Tweak them out to your particular note-taking style. All these are meant to do is give you a place to start.

To keep these as beginner friendly as possible, these are templates that don't require extra plugins.

Obsidian has an active developer community creating nifty and cool features, but don't get distracted in the bells and whistles that you forget the main purpose of your personal knowledge management system is to create and explore and ideate, not make your templates look pretty.

The included Templates are:

1. [[-master topic index log]]
2. [[Book Template]]
3. [[Cornell Notes Template]]
4. [[Daily Note Template]]
5. [[Eisenhower Matrix Template]]
6. [[Essay Template]]
7. [[Gym Template]]
8. [[Meeting Notes Template]]
9. [[Monthly Overview Template]]
10. [[New Notes Template]]
11. [[Project Notes Template]]
12. [[Topic Concept Template]]
13. [[Vision Planner Template]]
14. [[Weekly Overview Template]]
15. [[Year End Review Template]]


### Setting Up Templates

**Head over to settings in the bottom left corner:**
![[settings location.png | 200]]

Head over to the Core Plugins:
![[core plugins.png]]

**You can play around with the settings as you want, but the main ones we want to be on are the Daily Notes and Templates as below:**
![[template settings.png]]

**Click the ⚙️ button for both Templates and Daily notes. The steps will be the same or similar.**

1. Pick a folder you want to use for your templates. In this case, a folder already exists in this Starter Kit.
2. Select the folder location you want to use for your templates. (This is also where you can set up the Date and Time format for your preference.)
3. Voilà! Templates set up. Now, whenever you create a new template, just move it to your template folder and you'll be able to reference it later.

Now that you have your templates and daily notes set up, now you can forget about how you format your notes. You can either use one of your pre-built templates or you can make a new one that feeds your specific needs that you know will be recurring. That's the beauty of templates. They save time and let you focus on the actual writing and ideation.


### Using Templates
![[template button location.png | 200]]
1. Create a new blank note.
2. Give your note a title.
3. Hit *CTRL-P* on Windows or *Command-P* on MacOs to access the Command Palette.
4. Select *Template: Insert template option* **OR** click on the *Insert template* button on the left-hand side.
5. Select the template you want to use.
6. The empty note populates with the contents of your template file.


## Obsidian Date Formatting

To configure the date format to output a certain way, here's how:

No | Command | Description
---| --- | ---
0 | {{date}} | Prints out default date configurable in Settings
1 |{{date:DD-MM-YYYY}} | Prints date as Day-Month-Year (31/12/2020)
2 | {{date:MM-DD-YYYY}} | Prints date as Month-Day-Year (12/31/2020)
3 | {{date:YYYY-MM-DD}} | Prints date as Year-Month-Day (2020/12/31)

No. 0 defaults to whatever default date is configured in Settings. Which means this can be changed if you prefer one format over the other. You can also just copy/paste the {{date:format}} in your template instead if you prefer certain templates formatted one way.

## Graph View
This is a pretty cool feature in Obsidian. This is where the inspiration happens. In Obsidian, you link notes to each other by using square brackets on the referenced note name.  ```[[ ]]```  You can also see how notes are related by using tags  ```#Tag```, but for simplicity's sake, I only referenced the templates to this ReadMe file.

![[graph view.png | 500]]

When you first begin, there won't be a lot of linked notes. But as you let days become weeks and weeks become months, you'll have your own digital notes system referencing all the relevant ideas you have on a topic.

This is my current zettelkasten-inspired Obsidian graph view as of 22/04/22:
![[22-04-22 graph view.png | 400]]

Let your notes and ideas talk to each other and reference them wherever they seem relevant. Let your ideas form clusters around a certain insight and see where that rabbit hole takes you. That's the best way to utilize Obsidian or other wiki-linking software app you decide to try or migrate to. The ```[[ ]]``` referencing isn't exclusive to Obsidian. Other note-taking apps that enable wiki-links use the same formatting.

There are various knowledge management tools and frameworks people use for their fields, but at its basic element: Obsidian works best as a knowledge hub when notes reference each other. You can leave them alone for a year and come back to it still referencing other notes, but perhaps with a new perspective you didn't have before. That's a new note! Reference the relevant notes or update the ones you had. Linking ideas is how our brains work. We remember things by association and events, not as granular and detailed things, but as a reference to other ideas and memories.

## Demo Zettelkasten Sample Notes

*Updated as of September 2022.*

I’ve included a small demo use case for Obsidian so you can explore and play around with. It’s small on purpose so the graph view is easily accessible to see how connected the notes are, but as you write more notes, more clusters and interdependence will occur.

And remember, there’s no *right way* to take notes. The important thing is that you capture information that is meaningful to you. Make connections with your notes and don’t silo knowledge in one broad category. Chances are, that knowledge can be used in other categories.

You can hover over to the graph view to see the included demo. For a bird's eye view, start from the **master note**. Otherwise, feel free to explore and play around or delete the demo notes as you see fit.

## Conclusion

I hope you found some value out this Obsidian Starter Kit. Hopefully now the app doesn't look so daunting or anxiety-inducing staring at a blank note, unsure of where to start.

These templates only require the core plugins. These templates are meant to give you a starting point, see what you like, what you don't like, and customize your digital note experience.

With additional plugins, you can add neat features to optimize your templates to your needs. But you don't need to. In this world of digital tools for productivity, sometimes we get lost in customizing the tools than we do actually use them.
