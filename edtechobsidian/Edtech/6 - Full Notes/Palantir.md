5. **How to Build a Data-Driven Organization**:
    - **Step 1: Centralize Data**:
        - Break down silos by creating a single source of truth.
        - Foundry’s data integration capabilities allow organizations to connect disparate systems.
    - **Step 2: Build an Ontology**:
        - Create a digital representation of the organization’s operations.
        - Example: Mapping supply chain data to track inventory, suppliers, and logistics in real time.
    - **Step 3: Enable Collaboration**:
        - Provide tools for both technical (data scientists) and non-technical (business analysts) users.
        - User-friendly interfaces for querying data and building workflows.
    - **Step 4: Operationalize Insights**:
        - Use data to drive decisions at every level, from strategic planning to daily operations.
        - Example: Predictive analytics for demand forecasting or risk assessment.
    - **Step 5: Iterate and Scale**:
        - Continuously refine data models and workflows.
        - Scale solutions across departments or geographies.
