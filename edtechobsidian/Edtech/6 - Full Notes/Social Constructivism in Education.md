## Summary
Social constructivism posits that learning is a social, active process where knowledge is built through interaction. Fanguy et al. (2023) apply this to flipped learning collaboration.

## Key Points
- **Active Learning:** Knowledge via social activities (Vygotsky, 1978).
- **Facilitation:** Teachers as guides, not lecturers (Fleener et al., 2004).
- **Collaboration:** Essential for understanding (Ashcraft et al., 2008).
- **Application:** Online collaboration aids writing (Fanguy et al., 2023).

## Concepts
- **Cognitive Activity:** Learning through discussion.
- **Peer Interaction:** Co-construction of meaning.

## Notes
- Core to [[20230325A]] framework.
- Requires rich social environments (Ndon, 2011).
