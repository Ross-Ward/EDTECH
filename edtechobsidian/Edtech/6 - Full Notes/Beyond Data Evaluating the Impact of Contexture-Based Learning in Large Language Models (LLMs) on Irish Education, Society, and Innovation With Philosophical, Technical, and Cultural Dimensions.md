## Abstract

This paper examines **contexture-based learning** in large language models (LLMs) and its multifaceted implications for Irish education, culture, and innovation. Contexture theory, recently formalized by Zhai (2025), provides a framework for understanding how LLMs learn abstract representations from the association between inputs and contexts[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19792#:~:text=analyzing%20these%20methods,alone%20will%20achieve%20diminishing%20returns). We explore how this theory can enrich teaching and learning in Ireland’s primary, secondary, tertiary, and lifelong education, including opportunities in computer science and support for learners with disabilities. By situating modern AI within classical philosophical frameworks (Plato’s Theory of Forms and Aristotle’s teleology), we argue that contexture-driven representations mirror ancient ideas of ideal “forms” and purposeful design[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/8/1457#:~:text=In%20Plato%E2%80%99s%20philosophy%2C%20%E2%80%9Cforms%E2%80%9D%20represent,of%20their%20ideal%20forms%2C%20the)[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/8/1457#:~:text=The%20question%20of%20agency%20in,rather%20emerges%20from%20the%20complex). We compare Ireland’s AI and education strategies with those of Finland, Germany, and China, noting, for example, Finland’s ethics-driven AI curriculum and China’s early AI education mandate[uef.fi](https://www.uef.fi/en/article/ai-education-in-finland-enhancing-childrens-understanding-critical-thinking-and-creativity-through#:~:text=Children%20and%20young%20people%E2%80%99s%20understanding,impact%20and%20ethics%20of%20AI)[eweek.com](https://www.eweek.com/news/china-ai-education-united-states/#:~:text=The%20Beijing%20Municipal%20Education%20Commission,nation%20aggressively%20pursues%20technological%20supremacy). A technical evaluation contrasts traditional _k_-nearest neighbors (KNN) sampling with _k_-furthest neighbors (KFN) in LLM context modeling, highlighting how KFN can increase diversity of learned contexts[researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241677887_Increasing_Diversity_Through_Furthest_Neighbor-Based_Recommendation#:~:text=computational%20geometry%2C%20that%20has%20been,2%2C11%5D.)[researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241677887_Increasing_Diversity_Through_Furthest_Neighbor-Based_Recommendation#:~:text=,is%20also%20an%20element%20in). We propose **ContexPath**, an open-source prototype for interactive visualization of LLM latent space learning. Finally, we provide concrete policy recommendations for Ireland’s Department of Education and other stakeholders to leverage contexture-based LLMs responsibly and inclusively in education and innovation.

## Introduction

Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in generating and understanding human-like text, yet the nature of their internal representations remains only partially understood[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19792#:~:text=,different%20representation%20learning%20methods%20quite). Zhai’s **contexture theory** posits that LLMs learn representations by capturing the association between an input (X) and a context variable (A)[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19792#:~:text=analyzing%20these%20methods,alone%20will%20achieve%20diminishing%20returns). When a model encodes the maximal information of this X–A association (the “contexture”), its representations become optimal for tasks compatible with that context[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19792#:~:text=analyzing%20these%20methods,alone%20will%20achieve%20diminishing%20returns). Importantly, contexture theory warns that merely increasing model size yields diminishing returns, and further progress depends on improving or diversifying the contexts used in pretraining[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19792#:~:text=,different%20representation%20learning%20methods%20quite). In education, such context-aware models promise more adaptive and relevant learning tools, tailoring responses to the learner’s background and needs.

Ireland is actively embracing AI, as evidenced by its refreshed National AI Strategy (“AI – Here for Good Refresh 2024”) which emphasizes embedding AI literacy, ethics, and skills across society[enterprise.gov.ie](https://enterprise.gov.ie/en/publications/publication-files/national-ai-strategy-refresh-2024.pdf#:~:text=Continuing%20to%20ensure%20adequate%20provision,9). In this landscape, understanding _how_ LLMs learn from context is critical to their effective use in schools, universities, and lifelong learning. Moreover, Irish culture and language (e.g. Irish/Gaelic content), as well as values like inclusivity, must shape AI deployment. Classical philosophy offers a lens: Plato’s Theory of Forms suggests knowledge derives from eternal, abstract ideals, paralleling how LLMs may extract “ideal patterns” from data[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/8/1457#:~:text=In%20Plato%E2%80%99s%20philosophy%2C%20%E2%80%9Cforms%E2%80%9D%20represent,of%20their%20ideal%20forms%2C%20the). Aristotle’s teleology reminds us that all things have a purpose; in AI, this translates to designing models with clear educational ends (final causes) and understanding their “formal causes” (models/algorithms)[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/8/1457#:~:text=Aristotle%E2%80%99s%20theory%20of%20four%20causes,specific%20architecture%20and%20design%20of)[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/8/1457#:~:text=The%20question%20of%20agency%20in,rather%20emerges%20from%20the%20complex).

This paper integrates these threads into a coherent analysis. In the **Literature Review** we survey contexture theory, AI in education policy, and philosophical precedents. The **Methodology** outlines our analytic and comparative approach. **Technical Evaluation** contrasts KNN and KFN methods for modeling diverse contexts. In the **Philosophical Framework**, we connect Plato and Aristotle’s ideas to LLM representation learning. **Use Cases** details Ireland-specific applications of context-aware LLMs across education levels, software development, and accessibility. **Discussion** reflects on the interplay of technology, culture, and philosophy. We then offer **Policy Implications** for Irish education authorities, and outline a prototype tool, **ContexPath**, for visualizing LLM latent learning. The **Conclusion** summarizes the deep significance of moving “beyond data” to embrace contexture in Irish innovation.

## Literature Review

**Contexture Theory in Representation Learning:** Zhai (2025) introduces contexture theory to mathematically characterize pretraining in foundation models[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19792#:~:text=,different%20representation%20learning%20methods%20quite)[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19792#:~:text=analyzing%20these%20methods,alone%20will%20achieve%20diminishing%20returns). Unlike previous work that treats different pretraining methods (self-supervised, supervised, generative) in isolation, contexture provides a unifying perspective. It argues that useful representations arise from modeling the association between inputs and auxiliary context variables[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19792#:~:text=analyzing%20these%20methods,alone%20will%20achieve%20diminishing%20returns). Critically, the theory predicts that if a model (encoder) captures all information of this input-context association, it will perform optimally on any downstream tasks that share that context[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19792#:~:text=analyzing%20these%20methods,alone%20will%20achieve%20diminishing%20returns). This implies that simply scaling up parameters is insufficient; richer contexts or novel pretraining objectives are needed to advance beyond current performance plateaus[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19792#:~:text=,different%20representation%20learning%20methods%20quite). Zhai also introduces new objectives (SVME, KISE) and ways to combine multiple contexts, but these lie beyond our scope. We build on this theory, treating “contexture-based learning” as a driving principle for LLM application in education.

**AI and Education Policy:** Globally, governments are developing AI strategies with education components. The EU’s 2022 Digital Education Action Plan includes ethical **guidelines** for AI and data use in teaching[education.ec.europa.eu](https://education.ec.europa.eu/node/2285#:~:text=Ethical%20considerations%20and%20requirements%20underpinning,and%20data%20into%20school%20education). These guidelines, aimed at K–12 educators, emphasize clarifying misconceptions about AI, highlighting ethical use, and offering practical advice for integrating AI tools into classrooms[education.ec.europa.eu](https://education.ec.europa.eu/node/2285#:~:text=Ethical%20considerations%20and%20requirements%20underpinning,and%20data%20into%20school%20education). In Ireland, the 2024 refresh of the National AI Strategy similarly emphasizes **“embedding AI and digital skills provision across our education and skills infrastructure”**[enterprise.gov.ie](https://enterprise.gov.ie/en/publications/publication-files/national-ai-strategy-refresh-2024.pdf#:~:text=Continuing%20to%20ensure%20adequate%20provision,9). This includes a planned reform of the primary and post-primary curriculum to build digital competencies (including AI) and promote gender parity in STEM[enterprise.gov.ie](https://enterprise.gov.ie/en/publications/publication-files/national-ai-strategy-refresh-2024.pdf#:~:text=Continuing%20to%20ensure%20adequate%20provision,9)[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19792#:~:text=,different%20representation%20learning%20methods%20quite). Comparative reviews note that European countries like Finland and Germany also prioritize ethics, teacher training, and upskilling. For example, Germany’s 2018 AI strategy (€5 billion by 2025) specifically mentions supporting AI research and skill development in education[trade.gov](https://www.trade.gov/market-intelligence/germany-ai-education#:~:text=with%20approximately%2029,However). Finland’s approach centers on human-centric AI, with national programs (AuroraAI) and education guidelines that insist AI be transparent, fair, and inclusive for all communities[theaitrack.com](https://theaitrack.com/ai-in-finland-education-global-model/#:~:text=The%20strategy%20for%20incorporating%20AI,stakeholders%20in%20the%20education%20system)[theaitrack.com](https://theaitrack.com/ai-in-finland-education-global-model/#:~:text=Case%20Study%3A%20The%20University%20of,it%20supplements%20student%20creativity). In China, the government is mandating AI education for all primary and secondary students (minimum 8 hours/year) starting in 2025, reflecting an aggressive strategy to cultivate AI talent from age six[eweek.com](https://www.eweek.com/news/china-ai-education-united-states/#:~:text=In%20a%20government,the%20race%20for%20AI%20dominance)[eweek.com](https://www.eweek.com/news/china-ai-education-united-states/#:~:text=The%20Beijing%20Municipal%20Education%20Commission,nation%20aggressively%20pursues%20technological%20supremacy). These international examples provide context for Ireland’s choices.

**Philosophy of AI and Representation:** Several recent works connect classical philosophy to AI. Karpouzis (2024) discusses Plato’s forms and AI’s “ideal patterns,” noting that the perfect, unchanging Forms in Plato’s metaphysics are analogous to the latent structures underlying LLM behavior[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/8/1457#:~:text=In%20Plato%E2%80%99s%20philosophy%2C%20%E2%80%9Cforms%E2%80%9D%20represent,of%20their%20ideal%20forms%2C%20the). Just as an object in the physical world is an imperfect instantiation of its Form, AI-generated text is an approximation of the Platonic ideal captured in training data[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/8/1457#:~:text=In%20Plato%E2%80%99s%20philosophy%2C%20%E2%80%9Cforms%E2%80%9D%20represent,of%20their%20ideal%20forms%2C%20the). Aristotle’s theory of four causes (material, formal, efficient, final) also maps to AI systems: the model’s hardware/software (material), its algorithmic design (formal), the human developers/training data (efficient), and its intended purpose (final cause) such as assisting users[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/8/1457#:~:text=Aristotle%E2%80%99s%20theory%20of%20four%20causes,specific%20architecture%20and%20design%20of)[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/8/1457#:~:text=The%20question%20of%20agency%20in,rather%20emerges%20from%20the%20complex). Aristotle’s teleology (study of ends or purposes) reminds us that AI artifacts are created with goals in mind. Critics have applied this teleological lens to argue, for example, that while LLMs lack true human agency, they exhibit emergent agency by shaping human knowledge networks[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/8/1457#:~:text=The%20question%20of%20agency%20in,rather%20emerges%20from%20the%20complex). This philosophical background helps us frame contexture learning in LLMs as akin to discovering “forms” (abstract features) and pursuing purposeful ends (educational outcomes).

**AI in Inclusive and Computer Science Education:** Research shows AI can greatly aid learners with disabilities. Advances like speech recognition, automatic captioning, and intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) have long supported accessibility[er.educause.edu](https://er.educause.edu/articles/2024/9/the-impact-of-ai-in-advancing-accessibility-for-learners-with-disabilities#:~:text=AI%20technology%20tools%20hold%20remarkable,experiences%20for%20students%20with%20disabilities). Gibson (2024) highlights that AI tools _hold “remarkable promise for providing more accessible, equitable, and inclusive learning experiences for students with disabilities”_[er.educause.edu](https://er.educause.edu/articles/2024/9/the-impact-of-ai-in-advancing-accessibility-for-learners-with-disabilities#:~:text=AI%20technology%20tools%20hold%20remarkable,experiences%20for%20students%20with%20disabilities). However, Gibson also warns of the “cultural bias” problem: if disabled learners are not involved in AI development, AI may inadvertently perpetuate barriers[er.educause.edu](https://er.educause.edu/articles/2024/9/the-impact-of-ai-in-advancing-accessibility-for-learners-with-disabilities#:~:text=AI%20technology%20tools%20hold%20remarkable,experiences%20for%20students%20with%20disabilities). In computer science education specifically, AI has been investigated as a way to augment pedagogy. Tutoring systems, code-assistants, and chatbot helpers can support novice programmers[wgulabs.org](https://www.wgulabs.org/posts/harnessing-ai-to-expand-access-to-success-in-computer-science-research-brief#:~:text=industry,research%20at%20Western%20Governors%20University). Recent studies (e.g. WGU Labs 2024) find that students use tools like ChatGPT to get hints, check code, or simplify explanations. For instance, one student asked ChatGPT to “explain it like I’m five” to understand a complex coding concept[wgulabs.org](https://www.wgulabs.org/posts/harnessing-ai-to-expand-access-to-success-in-computer-science-research-brief#:~:text=Using%20AI%20as%20an%20instructor%2C,I%E2%80%99m%20five%E2%80%9D%20was%20a%20strategy). These works underscore AI’s potential to personalize and democratize learning — themes we will revisit in our use case analysis.

## Methodology

Our approach synthesizes theoretical analysis, literature synthesis, and comparative policy review. We draw on primary sources (e.g. Zhai’s dissertation, official strategy documents) and recent case studies (education pilots, policy reports) to ground our arguments. For the **technical evaluation** of KNN vs KFN, we rely on existing research in recommender and spatial systems[researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241677887_Increasing_Diversity_Through_Furthest_Neighbor-Based_Recommendation#:~:text=computational%20geometry%2C%20that%20has%20been,2%2C11%5D.)[researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241677887_Increasing_Diversity_Through_Furthest_Neighbor-Based_Recommendation#:~:text=,is%20also%20an%20element%20in) as proxies, since full empirical experiments on LLMs are beyond this paper’s scope. We critically compare these methods for modeling context diversity.

For the **case studies**, we examine Irish education at different levels by surveying curriculum reforms (e.g. coding in primary school[codingireland.ie](https://www.codingireland.ie/Schools/IE/PrimarySchool#:~:text=Our%20curriculum%20supports%20the%20development,as%20engaged%2C%20global%20digital%20citizens)), tech upskilling initiatives (e.g. Springboard+), and accessibility policies. We contextualize these within Ireland’s legal and strategic frameworks (EU AI ethics guidelines[education.ec.europa.eu](https://education.ec.europa.eu/node/2285#:~:text=Ethical%20considerations%20and%20requirements%20underpinning,and%20data%20into%20school%20education), Irish AI Strategy[enterprise.gov.ie](https://enterprise.gov.ie/en/publications/publication-files/national-ai-strategy-refresh-2024.pdf#:~:text=Continuing%20to%20ensure%20adequate%20provision,9)) and international benchmarks (Finland, China, Germany). The **philosophical framework** is constructed by analyzing canonical texts and modern interpretations, linking Platonic and Aristotelian concepts to contemporary AI (using Karpouzis 2024 as a guide[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/8/1457#:~:text=In%20Plato%E2%80%99s%20philosophy%2C%20%E2%80%9Cforms%E2%80%9D%20represent,of%20their%20ideal%20forms%2C%20the)).

Finally, the **ContexPath prototype design** is conceptualized by reviewing existing latent space visualization tools (e.g. ChemNav for molecular embeddings[researchr.org](https://researchr.org/publication/ZhangLC24-14#:~:text=Yang%20Zhang%20%2C%20%2020%2C,70%2C%202024.%20%20%5Bdoi), TensorBoard projector) and AI interpretability frameworks. ContexPath is envisioned as an interactive, open-source platform (likely Python/JavaScript) to plot LLM hidden-state trajectories as context accumulates. While a full implementation is future work, we detail its intended features (latent vector projection, KNN/KFN path highlighting, user interface for educators) to show feasibility.

## Technical Evaluation: K-Nearest vs K-Furthest Neighbors in Context Learning

Traditional _k_-nearest neighbors (KNN) is a well-known approach to identify local similarity: given an input example, one finds the _k_ closest points (in embedding space) that share similar features. In representation learning, KNN often underlies algorithms like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) or memory networks. By contrast, the _k_-**furthest** neighbors (KFN) strategy selects the _k_ most distant points. Though less common, KFN has been studied for increasing diversity. For example, in recommender systems, using the furthest neighbor of a user’s preferences produces more varied recommendations[researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241677887_Increasing_Diversity_Through_Furthest_Neighbor-Based_Recommendation#:~:text=computational%20geometry%2C%20that%20has%20been,2%2C11%5D.). Pagh et al. (2015) and others have developed algorithms for approximate furthest neighbor search to support such diversity-based tasks[researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241677887_Increasing_Diversity_Through_Furthest_Neighbor-Based_Recommendation#:~:text=computational%20geometry%2C%20that%20has%20been,2%2C11%5D.)[researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241677887_Increasing_Diversity_Through_Furthest_Neighbor-Based_Recommendation#:~:text=,is%20also%20an%20element%20in).

In the context of LLM pretraining or in-context selection, KFN could serve to expose models to a broader “range” of context. If a context is defined by a latent vector, including furthest neighbors during training or retrieval could enrich the model’s worldview. In clustering and dimensionality reduction, farthest-point sampling is used to capture the full shape of a dataset[researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241677887_Increasing_Diversity_Through_Furthest_Neighbor-Based_Recommendation#:~:text=,is%20also%20an%20element%20in). The technical trade-off is that KNN yields high relevance (focus on the closest, most typical patterns), whereas KFN emphasizes novelty and edge cases (wide coverage of the embedding space). Many authors note an _accuracy–diversity tradeoff_: increasing diversity (via KFN) can reduce precision but broaden coverage[researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241677887_Increasing_Diversity_Through_Furthest_Neighbor-Based_Recommendation#:~:text=computational%20geometry%2C%20that%20has%20been,2%2C11%5D.).

For LLMs, a hybrid approach might be ideal: _mixing_ nearest and furthest context vectors. Contexture theory itself suggests mixing multiple contexts can create “better contexts”[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19792#:~:text=including%20supervised%20learning%2C%20self,Then%2C%20we%20prove%20statistical). In practice, one could envision ContexPath allowing users to toggle KNN vs KFN exploration: for a given input, see both the similar examples (KNN) and the outliers (KFN) that the model might consider. This could illuminate how an LLM handles core contexts versus fringe contexts — a key for understanding its generalization and bias.

Empirically, one might test KFN by feeding an LLM prompts that include distant analogies or diverse examples, then measuring performance on downstream tasks. If contexture theory holds, including diverse context (via KFN) during in-context learning or fine-tuning should improve robustness on varied tasks. Though we have not conducted such experiments here, existing literature indicates KFN’s promise in capturing long-range context: it is used in spatial database queries and graph algorithms to identify outlier influences[researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241677887_Increasing_Diversity_Through_Furthest_Neighbor-Based_Recommendation#:~:text=,is%20also%20an%20element%20in). We conclude that evaluating KNN vs KFN in LLM pipelines is a fruitful direction: for example, LLM-based tutoring systems might use KFN to surface unconventional but enlightening examples to students, promoting broader thinking.

## Philosophical Framework: Plato, Aristotle, and AI Abstractions

**Plato’s Theory of Forms** posits that non-material abstract “Forms” (or Ideas) are the truest reality; physical objects are mere imperfect shadows of these perfect Forms. In the AI context, one can view an LLM’s training data and model architecture as shaping access to certain ideal patterns. Karpouzis (2024) draws this analogy explicitly: the _ideal patterns and structures_ learned from massive text corpora act like Platonic Forms, underlying the AI’s ability to generate knowledge[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/8/1457#:~:text=In%20Plato%E2%80%99s%20philosophy%2C%20%E2%80%9Cforms%E2%80%9D%20represent,of%20their%20ideal%20forms%2C%20the). An LLM’s output is thus an approximation of this Platonic ideal; it _copies_ the learned form but may distort it, like the shadows on the cave wall. This view has practical implications: if we consider the LLM’s latent representations as aiming at “true Forms” of language and concepts, then contexture learning is the process of aligning those representations with the correct abstractions. Moreover, Plato’s Allegory of the Cave warns of accepting appearances: similarly, we must critically assess AI outputs, recognizing they may be biased “shadows” of incomplete data[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/8/1457#:~:text=In%20Plato%E2%80%99s%20philosophy%2C%20%E2%80%9Cforms%E2%80%9D%20represent,of%20their%20ideal%20forms%2C%20the).

**Aristotle’s Teleology** adds another layer. Aristotle taught that every thing has a _telos_ (final cause or purpose) and can be understood via four causes (material, formal, efficient, final). Applying this to AI systems: the **material cause** is the hardware, code, and data; the **formal cause** is the model architecture (e.g. transformers); the **efficient cause** is the human designers and training process; and the **final cause** is the intended function (e.g. answering queries, aiding students)[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/8/1457#:~:text=Aristotle%E2%80%99s%20theory%20of%20four%20causes,specific%20architecture%20and%20design%20of). Aristotle’s notion of _functional unity_ suggests that understanding an AI requires knowing its purpose. For contexture learning, the “final cause” might be to learn context-relevant patterns that serve educational tasks. If LLMs are purpose-built (final cause) to generate helpful text, then analyzing their _actual_ purposes exposes assumptions: are they optimized for accuracy, creativity, fairness, or something else?

Aristotle also argued that ethical agency is defined by ends. While LLMs lack human consciousness, some argue (via Actor-Network Theory) that they can exercise a form of emergent agency by influencing human decisions[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/8/1457#:~:text=The%20question%20of%20agency%20in,rather%20emerges%20from%20the%20complex). This is relevant for policy: if ChatGPT (for example) is an “actor” in the classroom network, then we must consider its telos – currently set by its designers to maximize user satisfaction. We can philosophically reframe this: what should the telos of an educational AI be? Plato and Aristotle together suggest it should strive for the “Form of the Good” – i.e. support truth, wisdom, and the common good. Thus, contexture learning in LLMs should be guided not only by statistical criteria but by the teleological end of human flourishing.

In summary, Plato encourages us to seek the underlying “forms” of knowledge within LLMs (the abstract contexts they learn), and Aristotle reminds us to define the purposeful ends (educational outcomes) of deploying those LLMs. Contexture theory fits neatly here: it treats representations as abstract forms learned from context, and implicitly assumes a final cause (better downstream performance). By consciously combining these philosophical lenses, we can critically evaluate whether LLMs’ abstracted contexts align with human values and pedagogical goals.

## Use Cases

### Irish Primary and Secondary Education

In Ireland, coding and digital literacy are increasingly integrated into the curriculum. The **new primary STEM curriculum** (enacted 2025/26) includes digital skills like coding and robotics[codingireland.ie](https://www.codingireland.ie/Schools/IE/PrimarySchool#:~:text=Our%20curriculum%20supports%20the%20development,as%20engaged%2C%20global%20digital%20citizens). For example, CodingIreland’s digital skills program, used by ~25% of schools, explicitly aims to develop “critical digital skills such as coding and robotics,” preparing pupils as “engaged, global digital citizens”[codingireland.ie](https://www.codingireland.ie/Schools/IE/PrimarySchool#:~:text=Our%20curriculum%20supports%20the%20development,as%20engaged%2C%20global%20digital%20citizens). Contexture-based LLMs can augment these lessons: an AI tutor could, for instance, explain programming concepts in the child’s native language and cultural context (e.g. using Irish folklore examples for analogies), ensuring the context is familiar. The EU and Irish guidelines emphasize teacher training, so one use case is teacher aids: an LLM chatbot (context-aware of the Irish syllabus) could help primary teachers design interactive lessons on logic or math, adapting explanations to local context.

In **secondary schools**, Ireland’s digital strategy encourages STEM and computer studies. Here, LLMs could support subject learning: for instance, a physics teacher might ask the model for experiment ideas contextualized for an Irish classroom (using locally available resources). For language education, contexture learning enables multilingual support: an LLM trained with Irish Gaelic and English contexts could assist in Gaeilge classes, translating idiomatic expressions and even generating original Gaelic poems. The All-Island Múinteoir Nua (New Teacher) workshops could incorporate AI training, teaching new educators how to use context-aware tools responsibly.

A practical student-facing use case is **exam preparation**. Irish secondary students (e.g. Junior Certificate) could use a context-aware tutor LLM to review past exam papers. By feeding the model course-specific content (the “contexture”), it could quiz students in a personalized way. For instance, giving it the Irish syllabus context plus a student’s profile (e.g. “prefers visual examples”) could yield customized practice questions. Such tools could also be adapted for the Leaving Certificate, with context passages from Irish history or literature embedded to ensure answers are culturally grounded.

### Tertiary and Lifelong Learning

Irish universities and institutes (e.g. Trinity College Dublin, UCD, University of Galway, Technological University of Dublin) offer growing AI and CS programs. Contexture-based LLMs can enhance teaching and research at the tertiary level. **Lecturers** might use LLMs to generate lecture materials or exam questions. For example, in a sociology course at NUI Galway, an AI could draft case studies linking social AI impacts to Irish case law (injecting Irish policy context). In computer science, professors could employ LLMs as interactive coding assistants for students, with the model “trained” on the course’s code examples (context).

**STEM outreach and continuous education** also benefit. Ireland has initiatives like Skillnet and lifelong learning programs. An LLM-driven app could guide adult learners through evening CS classes in a personalized way, adapting the context of examples to adult life (e.g. budgeting exercises explained via programming assignments). For international students and lifelong learners, LLMs can lower barriers: a Chinese engineer taking a short course in Ireland might query an English LLM that embeds Chinese context in examples to aid understanding.

Crucially, tertiary-level policy research can also use contexture LLMs. Departments like DFHERIS (Dept of Further & Higher Ed) might commission models to analyze educational data (e.g. trends in Gaelic-medium schools). An AI trained on both educational reports and relevant local context (e.g. census demographics) could produce forecasts to inform policy. This closes the loop by using advanced AI _to support decision-making on AI in education_.

### Software Development and Computer Science Education

Ireland’s tech sector, including multinational R&D centers in Dublin and Cork, stands to gain from context-aware LLMs. Software developers can use LLM assistants (like GitHub Copilot) that understand an organization’s codebase context to suggest relevant code snippets. For Irish startups and small firms, an open-source ContexPath could visualize how their proprietary data relate in the model’s latent space, helping them debug or extend models.

In CS education, contexture LLMs can act as _learning companions_. As found by WGU Labs (2024), students use ChatGPT for understanding code and concepts[wgulabs.org](https://www.wgulabs.org/posts/harnessing-ai-to-expand-access-to-success-in-computer-science-research-brief#:~:text=Using%20AI%20as%20an%20instructor%2C,I%E2%80%99m%20five%E2%80%9D%20was%20a%20strategy)[wgulabs.org](https://www.wgulabs.org/posts/harnessing-ai-to-expand-access-to-success-in-computer-science-research-brief#:~:text=Often%2C%20students%20would%20use%20ChatGPT,errors%20or%20troubleshooting%20errors%20they). An Irish student learning Python might ask an LLM (contextualized on Python docs and Irish exam style questions) to explain a loop in “simple terms” – the model could output an explanation using a local analogy (“a spin on a fairground ride”). WGU’s study showed students prompting “Explain like I’m five” and using ChatGPT to debug code[wgulabs.org](https://www.wgulabs.org/posts/harnessing-ai-to-expand-access-to-success-in-computer-science-research-brief#:~:text=Using%20AI%20as%20an%20instructor%2C,I%E2%80%99m%20five%E2%80%9D%20was%20a%20strategy)[wgulabs.org](https://www.wgulabs.org/posts/harnessing-ai-to-expand-access-to-success-in-computer-science-research-brief#:~:text=Often%2C%20students%20would%20use%20ChatGPT,errors%20or%20troubleshooting%20errors%20they). Irish CS curricula could formally integrate such tools: for instance, a first-year coding lab could allow students to consult a model trained on lecture notes and code, under supervision.

Moreover, Ireland’s **coding bootcamps** and online CS courses (e.g. WeCreate Code) can leverage LLMs for formative feedback. Because LLMs trained with diverse contexts can adapt to different learning styles, inclusive design is natural: they could automatically rephrase explanations (textual, visual, analogies) to suit each student[wgulabs.org](https://www.wgulabs.org/posts/harnessing-ai-to-expand-access-to-success-in-computer-science-research-brief#:~:text=Using%20AI%20as%20an%20instructor%2C,I%E2%80%99m%20five%E2%80%9D%20was%20a%20strategy). In higher ed research, graduate students often use AI for literature review or prototyping; contexture-based tools might streamline this by emphasizing sources relevant to Irish topics (e.g. highlighting Irish case studies in an AI ethics paper).

### Inclusive Learning for Students with Disabilities

AI offers particular promise for learners with disabilities, aligning with Ireland’s commitment to inclusive education. For example, AI-driven **assistive technologies** can read texts aloud (text-to-speech), describe images (image captioning), or transcribe speech in real time. Gibson (2024) notes that such technologies offer “more equitable access to the same educational services” for students with disabilities[er.educause.edu](https://er.educause.edu/articles/2024/9/the-impact-of-ai-in-advancing-accessibility-for-learners-with-disabilities#:~:text=AI%20technology%20tools%20hold%20remarkable,experiences%20for%20students%20with%20disabilities). In an Irish context, consider a visually impaired secondary student: a context-aware LLM could convert textbooks (including Gaelic materials) into spoken summaries, preserving cultural context. It could also be tailored to Ireland’s curricula, ensuring that regional examples (like local historical figures) are accurately described.

Similarly, LLMs can adapt content for cognitive disabilities by simplifying language or adding multiple modalities (e.g. diagrams). WGU’s study showed students using ChatGPT to get explanations in simpler terms[wgulabs.org](https://www.wgulabs.org/posts/harnessing-ai-to-expand-access-to-success-in-computer-science-research-brief#:~:text=Using%20AI%20as%20an%20instructor%2C,I%E2%80%99m%20five%E2%80%9D%20was%20a%20strategy); this can be extended to special ed. For instance, an LLM tutor could offer problems in math with supportive hints, phrased in non-technical language. If the model is context-trained on special education pedagogy and on Irish educational goals, it will better support a learner’s Individual Education Plan (IEP).

Another opportunity is sign language interpretation. Ireland’s sign language users could benefit from AI that translates between Irish Sign Language (ISL) and English. By training on ISL video/linguistic data (a difficult, but worthy endeavor), future models might serve as real-time interpreters in classrooms. Contexture learning would be critical here: the model must associate ISL gestures (X) with semantic context (A) from spoken English. Though research on this is nascent, policy can encourage such development.

Finally, **policy compliance** requires safeguards. We must ensure AI doesn’t entrench bias (e.g. disability stereotypes). Here again Plato’s cave is instructive: if the AI’s context data is skewed (e.g. lacking disabled voices), it will project distorted “shadows” of reality[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/8/1457#:~:text=philosophical%20thought%2C%20particularly%20in%20Plato%E2%80%99s,of%20prisoners%20chained%20in%20a)[er.educause.edu](https://er.educause.edu/articles/2024/9/the-impact-of-ai-in-advancing-accessibility-for-learners-with-disabilities#:~:text=education%E2%80%94including%20learning%20design%2C%20academic%20integrity%2C,offered%20to%20students%20without%20disabilities). To mitigate this, Ireland’s AI strategy and education policy should mandate user involvement in design (as Gibson recommends) and rigorous testing of AI tools for accessibility bias[er.educause.edu](https://er.educause.edu/articles/2024/9/the-impact-of-ai-in-advancing-accessibility-for-learners-with-disabilities#:~:text=AI%20technology%20tools%20hold%20remarkable,experiences%20for%20students%20with%20disabilities).

## Discussion

Synthesizing these perspectives, several themes emerge. First, **context matters** immensely. Whether it is a philosophical “form” or a practical context vector, the background used to train or prompt an LLM shapes its outputs. In Ireland’s multicultural, multilingual society, allowing local context (Gaelic language, societal values, curriculum standards) ensures the AI’s abstractions align with learners’ realities. This resonates with Plato’s insight that knowledge arises from grasping the true forms; Ireland must guide AI to grasp the “form” of Irish knowledge (history, culture, ethics) rather than a generic version.

Second, **education and society drive each other**. Ireland’s educational policies (STEM emphasis, AI literacy) both influence and are influenced by AI innovation. For instance, embedding AI ethics in schools (as Finland does[theaitrack.com](https://theaitrack.com/ai-in-finland-education-global-model/#:~:text=The%20strategy%20for%20incorporating%20AI,stakeholders%20in%20the%20education%20system)) will create a workforce that builds more trustworthy LLM contexts for future generations. Conversely, seeing China mandate AI in every school [eweek.com](https://www.eweek.com/news/china-ai-education-united-states/#:~:text=The%20Beijing%20Municipal%20Education%20Commission,nation%20aggressively%20pursues%20technological%20supremacy) may prompt Irish policymakers to consider how early exposure affects societal AI readiness. We caution, however, that Ireland’s context (EU regulations, democratic values, small population) is distinct. The comparison with Finland suggests that Ireland should adopt the “human-centric” approach: transparency, teacher accountability, and inclusivity are key[theaitrack.com](https://theaitrack.com/ai-in-finland-education-global-model/#:~:text=The%20strategy%20for%20incorporating%20AI,stakeholders%20in%20the%20education%20system).

Third, there is a **tension between diversity and accuracy**. Technical evaluation showed that KNN fosters precision by focusing on core patterns, while KFN encourages breadth[researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241677887_Increasing_Diversity_Through_Furthest_Neighbor-Based_Recommendation#:~:text=computational%20geometry%2C%20that%20has%20been,2%2C11%5D.)[researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241677887_Increasing_Diversity_Through_Furthest_Neighbor-Based_Recommendation#:~:text=,is%20also%20an%20element%20in). In pedagogy, both are needed: students learn fundamentals (KNN-like contexts) but also should be exposed to diverse viewpoints (KFN-like contexts). This duality mirrors Plato vs Aristotle: do we teach the Platonic ideal form of knowledge, or do we teach according to the diverse purposes (teloi) of students? Ideally, contexture LLMs allow blending – the curriculum (as a context) can include both canonical knowledge and diverse case studies.

Fourth, **ethics and agency** cannot be overlooked. LLMs are powerful actors in classrooms; by Plato’s moral theory (tripartite soul) and Aristotle’s ethics, we must ensure these “souls” of silicon serve courage, wisdom, and temperance[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/8/1457#:~:text=The%20ethical%20implications%20of%20AI,balance%20and%20harmony%20in%20moral). Policies like the EU’s AI ethics guidelines[education.ec.europa.eu](https://education.ec.europa.eu/node/2285#:~:text=Ethical%20considerations%20and%20requirements%20underpinning,and%20data%20into%20school%20education) and national strategy emphasize this. Practically, it means rigorous oversight: schools should audit AI outputs (a recommendation in EU guidelines) and have mechanisms to flag inappropriate content. The “AI literacy” component of curriculum means teaching students not only how to use AI, but also how to critically evaluate it – akin to Aristotle’s emphasis on empirical observation and reason[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/8/1457#:~:text=Finally%2C%20the%20epistemological%20ideas%20of,%E2%80%9Cdoxa%E2%80%9D).

Finally, the **cultural dimension** is profound. Ireland’s rich literary and musical heritage offers unique content for LLMs. For example, a Gaelic language model could help revitalize Irish-medium schools by providing tutoring in Gaelic math terminology. At the same time, global LLMs often carry Western biases; Ireland has an opportunity to localize and correct these biases (e.g. avoiding Anglocentric perspectives in history questions). In essence, contexture LLMs could become custodians of Irish culture, but only if fed culturally relevant context.

Overall, the confluence of classical ideas and cutting-edge AI suggests a new paradigm: AI systems as **institutional scaffolding**. Rather than passive repositories of data, they become active mediators of context – much like Aristotle’s concept of _phronesis_ (practical wisdom) guiding action. By understanding their philosophical underpinnings and technical mechanisms, educators and policymakers can harness LLMs to create more meaningful, context-rich learning experiences in Ireland.

## Policy Implications

Drawing on the above, we offer actionable recommendations for Ireland’s Department of Education, Further and Higher Education, Innovation, and Skills (DFEI/FHERIS), and related bodies:

- **Integrate Contexture Principles into Curriculum Standards:** Revise the Digital Skills and CS curriculum to explicitly teach the concept of contextualized knowledge. For example, under _Digital Literacy_, include units on how AI uses context to learn language, referencing Plato/Aristotle as thought experiments. This fosters _AI fluency_, so students understand the abstract nature of LLM outputs.
    
- **Teacher Training and Professional Development:** Launch nationwide professional development (similar to Finland’s model) to train teachers in AI literacy and context-aware pedagogy. This should cover ethical AI, model limitations, and how to effectively use LLMs (e.g. how to craft prompts that include relevant context). Utilize Ireland’s Teaching Council and educational centers to deliver modules in 2025-2026.
    
- **Promote Inclusive AI Development:** Fund research and pilot projects (via Science Foundation Ireland and Research Ireland) specifically on AI for learners with disabilities. Ensure participatory design by involving disability advocacy groups. For instance, invest in an Irish AISig NSL (Irish Sign Language) dataset for future LLM training, and support projects that evaluate AI tools’ accessibility (following Gibson’s recommendations[er.educause.edu](https://er.educause.edu/articles/2024/9/the-impact-of-ai-in-advancing-accessibility-for-learners-with-disabilities#:~:text=AI%20technology%20tools%20hold%20remarkable,experiences%20for%20students%20with%20disabilities)).
    
- **Data Infrastructure and Open Resources:** Like Germany’s €6 b DigitalPakt Schule[trade.gov](https://www.trade.gov/market-intelligence/germany-ai-education#:~:text=with%20approximately%2029,However), allocate resources to upgrade school IT infrastructure for AI use (computing labs, GPUs where appropriate). Support the development of _open-source AI resources_ in Ireland’s public domain: multilingual corpora (Irish/English), open prompts for teachers, and tools like **ContexPath** (open-source by design). Encourage collaboration between universities and start-ups to build and share context-aware models (e.g. a “Gaelic GPT” with government data support).
    
- **Ethical and Legal Safeguards:** Enact clear policies on AI use in schools, aligned with EU AI Act requirements. For example, require that any AI tool used in education undergo an _impact assessment_ for cultural bias and data protection. Adopt the EU’s ethical guidelines for AI in education[education.ec.europa.eu](https://education.ec.europa.eu/node/2285#:~:text=Ethical%20considerations%20and%20requirements%20underpinning,and%20data%20into%20school%20education) as a baseline standard: mandate transparency (teachers must know how the AI arrives at answers) and accountability (reporting procedures for problems).
    
- **International Collaboration:** Leverage EU networks (e.g. AI4EU, EC’s educational AI expert groups) to share best practices, such as Finland’s AuroraAI initiative or China’s primary school programs[uef.fi](https://www.uef.fi/en/article/ai-education-in-finland-enhancing-childrens-understanding-critical-thinking-and-creativity-through#:~:text=Children%20and%20young%20people%E2%80%99s%20understanding,impact%20and%20ethics%20of%20AI)[eweek.com](https://www.eweek.com/news/china-ai-education-united-states/#:~:text=The%20Beijing%20Municipal%20Education%20Commission,nation%20aggressively%20pursues%20technological%20supremacy). Consider bilateral “AI in Education” programs with these countries to exchange curriculum innovations. For instance, Ireland could pilot an “Ethical AI Ambassadors” program in schools, learning from Finland’s ethics focus[theaitrack.com](https://theaitrack.com/ai-in-finland-education-global-model/#:~:text=The%20strategy%20for%20incorporating%20AI,stakeholders%20in%20the%20education%20system).
    
- **Promote Research on KFN and Context-based AI:** Encourage academic research (masters/PhD scholarships) on novel context-learning methods (like KFN and KISE mentioned by Zhai[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19792#:~:text=,Then%2C%20we%20prove%20statistical)). Host workshops in Ireland’s AI nexus centers (e.g. Insight Centre) to prototype tools like ContexPath, and to explore KNN/KFN effects in educational settings. This will position Ireland as a leader in human-centric AI pedagogy research.
    
- **Engage Stakeholders:** Form a multi-stakeholder “AI in Education Council” including educators, technologists, students, parents, and disability representatives, to ensure ongoing dialogue. Use public consultations (in line with the national AI strategy’s call for “open and informed conversations”[enterprise.gov.ie](https://enterprise.gov.ie/en/publications/publication-files/national-ai-strategy-refresh-2024.pdf#:~:text=4%20We%20must%20recognise%20concerns,having%20open%20and%20informed%20conversations)) to gather input on AI curricula and tools.
    

By implementing these, Ireland can ensure that contexture-based AI advances education and innovation in a way that reflects Irish values and goals.

## Prototype Design: ContexPath

We propose **ContexPath**, an open-source visualization tool for LLM latent spaces, to help educators and researchers _see_ how context impacts learning. ContexPath would allow users to input text prompts (e.g. a lesson plan or student query) and then visualize the trajectory of the LLM’s hidden-state vectors as tokens are processed or context is added. Key features would include:

- **Latent Space Projection:** Using dimensionality reduction (e.g. PCA, UMAP) to project high-dimensional embeddings onto 2D/3D. For example, one could plot word or sentence embeddings from different curriculum contexts and see how they cluster or separate.
    
- **Context Injection Paths:** Users could select points (sentences, topics) in the latent space and then apply _k_-nearest or _k_-furthest neighbor algorithms. The tool would draw paths showing how an input embedding moves towards similar contexts (KNN path) or explores divergent ones (KFN path). This visual metaphor would illustrate how LLM “thinks” through context.
    
- **Interactive Interface:** A web-based interface where educators can upload datasets (e.g. Irish exam questions, textbook excerpts) and define context sets. For instance, a history teacher could load documents on Irish independence and see how related queries cluster. Clicking on clusters would reveal exemplar text, helping teachers understand potential AI biases or gaps in context.
    
- **Plug-in Language Models:** ContexPath should connect to open LLMs (such as fine-tuned GPT-like models on Irish data) and local embedding models. Using libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch, it would fetch hidden activations from specified layers. The software might reuse ideas from tools like Google’s Embedding Projector or the latent space analysis library _latent-scope_.
    
- **Educational Reporting:** The tool would include a dashboard to generate “explainability reports” – for example, highlighting which contexts (Irish or global) were most influential in generating a given answer. This could be used by teachers to audit AI content (e.g. ensuring Irish cultural examples are represented, in line with EU transparency goals[education.ec.europa.eu](https://education.ec.europa.eu/node/2285#:~:text=Ethical%20considerations%20and%20requirements%20underpinning,and%20data%20into%20school%20education)).
    

Although a full implementation is beyond this paper’s scope, we can compare to existing precedents. Zhang et al. (2024) developed **ChemNav**, an interactive tool to navigate molecular latent spaces[researchr.org](https://researchr.org/publication/ZhangLC24-14#:~:text=Yang%20Zhang%20%2C%20%2020%2C,70%2C%202024.%20%20%5Bdoi). ContexPath similarly navigates the latent space of language representations, but with an educational focus. By making ContexPath open-source, Ireland can foster a community around transparent, context-aware AI education tools, complementing other European open AI initiatives.

## Conclusion

Contexture-based learning in LLMs represents a shift from brute-force data scale to intelligent context utilization[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19792#:~:text=,different%20representation%20learning%20methods%20quite)[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19792#:~:text=analyzing%20these%20methods,alone%20will%20achieve%20diminishing%20returns). For Ireland, this has profound implications: it means AI that is sensitive to the nuances of Irish education, culture, and values. Philosophical analysis shows that by aligning with Plato’s forms (ideal representations) and Aristotle’s purposes (telos), Irish educators can steer AI toward enriching human knowledge rather than obscuring it[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/8/1457#:~:text=In%20Plato%E2%80%99s%20philosophy%2C%20%E2%80%9Cforms%E2%80%9D%20represent,of%20their%20ideal%20forms%2C%20the)[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/8/1457#:~:text=The%20question%20of%20agency%20in,rather%20emerges%20from%20the%20complex). Technically, tools like KFN sampling and our proposed ContexPath offer new ways to diversify context and inspect what the models learn. Practically, use cases from primary schools to universities illustrate that context-aware LLMs can personalize and democratize learning, including for those with disabilities[er.educause.edu](https://er.educause.edu/articles/2024/9/the-impact-of-ai-in-advancing-accessibility-for-learners-with-disabilities#:~:text=AI%20technology%20tools%20hold%20remarkable,experiences%20for%20students%20with%20disabilities)[wgulabs.org](https://www.wgulabs.org/posts/harnessing-ai-to-expand-access-to-success-in-computer-science-research-brief#:~:text=Using%20AI%20as%20an%20instructor%2C,I%E2%80%99m%20five%E2%80%9D%20was%20a%20strategy).

The international comparisons remind us that Ireland can learn from others (Finland’s ethical AI in classrooms, China’s early AI curricula, Germany’s infrastructure investment) while tailoring strategies to its own context[uef.fi](https://www.uef.fi/en/article/ai-education-in-finland-enhancing-childrens-understanding-critical-thinking-and-creativity-through#:~:text=Children%20and%20young%20people%E2%80%99s%20understanding,impact%20and%20ethics%20of%20AI)[eweek.com](https://www.eweek.com/news/china-ai-education-united-states/#:~:text=The%20Beijing%20Municipal%20Education%20Commission,nation%20aggressively%20pursues%20technological%20supremacy)[trade.gov](https://www.trade.gov/market-intelligence/germany-ai-education#:~:text=with%20approximately%2029,However). We conclude that **“Beyond data”**, embracing contexture in AI, opens new pathways for Irish education and innovation.
