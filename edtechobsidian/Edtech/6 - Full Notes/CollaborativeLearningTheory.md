## Summary
Collaborative learning theory, rooted in Vygotsky’s social constructivism, posits that knowledge is constructed through social interaction rather than in isolation. Learning occurs as peers collaborate, scaffold each other, and negotiate meaning, a framework central to Fanguy et al.’s (2023) study of online collaboration in flipped classrooms.

## Key Points
- **Social Process:** Knowledge emerges from group activities, not solitary study (Vygotsky, 1978).
- **Scaffolding:** More knowledgeable peers or instructors guide novices to independence (Storch, 2018).
- **Benefits:** Enhances critical thinking, exposes diverse perspectives, and builds shared understanding (Fung, 2010).
- **Application:** Online forums and note-taking in flipped courses exemplify this theory (Fanguy et al., 2023).

## Concepts
- **Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD):** Learning potential unlocked through collaboration.
- **Collaborative Elaboration:** Meaningful understanding via peer discussion (Van Meter & Stevens, 2000).

## Notes
- Supports [[20230325A]] findings: collaboration improves writing performance.
- Limitation: Effectiveness depends on group dynamics and participation quality.
