## Summary
Neuro-education applies brain science to optimize learning. Thimmanna et al. (2024) suggest AI can align curricula with cognitive principles.

## Key Points
- **Brain-Based:** Enhances retention (Howard-Jones, 2014).
- **Adaptation:** AI matches neural preferences (Thimmanna et al., 2024).
- **Memory:** Optimizes info processing.
- **Evidence:** Supports diverse learners.

## Concepts
- **Neuroplasticity:** Brain adapts to learning.
- **Cognitive Enhancement:** Targeted strategies.
