## Summary
Flipped classrooms invert traditional teaching by delivering instructional content online (e.g., videos) before class, reserving face-to-face time for interactive, collaborative activities. This approach offers flexibility, enhances engagement, and supports diverse learners, as evidenced by studies like Fanguy et al. (2023).

## Key Points
- **Flexibility:** Students access materials at their own pace, accommodating varied schedules (Tang et al., 2020).
- **Engagement:** In-class collaboration fosters active learning, improving comprehension (Fisher et al., 2021).
- **Inclusivity:** Benefits introverts and quieter students by allowing pre-class preparation (Zainuddin & Attaran, 2016).
- **Performance:** Online collaboration (e.g., forums, note-taking) boosts writing skills in flipped contexts (Fanguy et al., 2023).

## Concepts
- **Active Learning:** Students apply knowledge in class, not just passively receive it (Prince, 2004).
- **Student-Centered:** Self-paced online learning tailors education to individual needs.

## Notes
- Challenges include time constraints and isolation in online phases, mitigated by collaboration (Lo & Hew, 2017).
