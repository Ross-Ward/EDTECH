# Leveraging LLMs for Adaptive Irish Language Proficiency Testing in Primary Education

## Abstract
This study proposes an LLM-based adaptive testing system for assessing Irish language proficiency in primary schools, addressing the lack of technology-driven, culturally relevant assessments. The system dynamically adjusts question difficulty, enhancing engagement and supporting Irish language preservation.

## Introduction
- Importance of Irish language education in Ireland
- Limitations of current proficiency assessments
- Potential of LLMs for adaptive testing
- Research gap: No LLM-based systems for Irish language testing

## Literature Review
- Irish language education policies (e.g., 20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language)
- LLM applications in education (e.g., personalization, content generation)[](https://arxiv.org/html/2403.18105v1)
- Adaptive testing frameworks in EdTech

## Methodology
- **Model Development**: Fine-tune an LLM (e.g., Llama-based) on Irish language corpora
- **Data Collection**: Collaborate with Gaelscoileanna for student data and feedback
- **Experiment**: Pilot the system in 10 primary schools, comparing outcomes with traditional tests
- **Analysis**: Quantitative (test scores, engagement metrics) and qualitative (teacher interviews)

## Expected Results
- Improved student engagement and proficiency
- High accuracy in question generation
- Challenges: Data scarcity, teacher training needs

## Discussion
- Implications for Irish language preservation
- Scalability to other low-resource languages
- Ethical considerations (e.g., data privacy, cultural accuracy)

## Conclusion
- Summary of findings
- Recommendations for EdTech policy in Ireland
