@**Title: Evolving Educational Practices through Targeted EdTech Interventions**

### 1. **Introduction**

This proposal advocates for an _evolutionary_ rather than _revolutionary_ change in educational practices, recognizing the need to build on what currently works rather than overhauling systems entirely. The intervention is grounded in current literature, informed decision-making, and practical classroom experience, balancing what has been read, understood, and interpreted through the lens of daily teaching realities.

### 2. **Problem Statement**

Educational technologies are often adopted without critical reflection on their real impact. The issue lies in a gap between tool adoption and measurable student engagement and success. This project seeks to intervene where technology use is frequent but often ineffective or underutilized.

### 3. **Importance of the Problem**

This issue is important because EdTech continues to shape modern pedagogy. Without proper evaluation, schools may invest in tools that do not contribute to meaningful learning outcomes. Research shows that the _mere presence_ of technology does not guarantee its effective use.

### 4. **Literature Review (Why is the literature important?)**

The literature highlights the need for informed, evidence-based decisions when implementing educational tools. Studies emphasize the necessity of teacher agency, student-centered design, and ongoing feedback loops. This project builds upon existing research to test how micro-level interventions can lead to macro-level improvements.

### 5. **Proposed Intervention**

Introduce a specific EdTech tool or method (e.g., a learning analytics dashboard, an interactive quiz platform, a peer-feedback app), designed to:

- Improve student engagement
    
- Make learning progress visible to students and teachers
    
- Encourage active, reflective learning
    

### 6. **How Does My Intervention Address the Issue?**

- **Makes the issue visible:** Shows where engagement or comprehension drops off.
    
- **Fixes the problem:** Provides data-driven strategies to adapt instruction in real time.
    
- **Promotes informed decision-making:** Teachers adapt lessons based on evidence, not assumptions.
    

### 7. **Data Collection Plan (What data will I capture?)**

You will collect both **quantitative** and **qualitative** data:

- **Quantitative:** Usage statistics, time-on-task, quiz scores, tool interaction frequency
    
- **Qualitative:** Student feedback, teacher reflections, focus groups, observation notes
    

### 8. **How Will I Measure Impact?**

- Pre- and post-intervention comparisons (engagement, performance, satisfaction)
    
- Surveys and interviews to assess perception shifts
    
- Analytics from the EdTech tool (log data, progress tracking)
    

### 9. **Analysis Plan**

- **For Students:** Analyze engagement patterns, academic performance, participation trends
    
- **For Teachers:** Analyze how the tool changed planning, interaction, and feedback cycles
    
- **For EdTech Efficacy:** Evaluate alignment between intended use and actual outcomes
    

### 10. **Has It Made a Difference?**

The intervention’s success will be determined by:

- Increased engagement
    
- Improved academic outcomes
    
- Enhanced teacher awareness and responsiveness
    
- Evidence of sustainable change
    

### 11. **Generalization to Capstone Data & Future Projects**

This model can be replicated or adapted in future capstone or educational projects by:

- Applying the same framework to other tools or contexts
    
- Scaling data collection for larger cohorts
    
- Sharing findings for institutional policy or training purposes
