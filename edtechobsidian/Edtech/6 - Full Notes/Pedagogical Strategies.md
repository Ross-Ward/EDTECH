## Summary

This note focuses on pedagogical strategies for developing attentional literacy (AL) in digital higher education, as identified in a Delphi study. These strategies blend contemplative and experiential approaches to help educators and students enhance focus, awareness, and intentional attention in online learning environments.

## Key Findings

- **Top Strategies:** Relate AL to students’ lives, teach intentional attention, use contemplative practices (e.g., mindfulness, breathwork), and allow time for engagement.
- **Experiential Focus:** Strategies emphasize active, hands-on learning over passive lecturing.
- **Holistic Approach:** Combine pedagogical and contemplative methods seamlessly.
- **No Digital Specificity:** Effective strategies apply across digital and non-digital contexts.

## Methodology

- **Design:** Extracted from a three-round Delphi study with CP educators.
- **Data:** Panellist rankings and comments on teaching strategies (n=7 initially, n=5 for rankings).
- **Approach:** Qualitative consensus on practical AL development methods.

## Concepts

- **Pedagogical Strategies:** Teaching methods designed to foster specific competencies (e.g., AL).
- **Experiential Learning:** Learning through direct experience and reflection.
- **Contemplative Practices:** Techniques like mindfulness that enhance attention and presence.

## Notes

- Strategies prioritize skills and attitudes, aligning with AL’s focus.
- Time and institutional support are critical for implementation.
- Panellists see good pedagogy as universal, not just digital.
