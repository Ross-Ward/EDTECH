## Summary

This note explores mindfulness in education as a core component of contemplative pedagogy (CP), linked to fostering attentional literacy (AL) in digital higher education. It highlights how mindfulness practices help educators and students manage attention amidst digital disarray, based on insights from a Delphi study.

## Key Findings

- **Definition:** Mindfulness is intentional, nonjudgmental attention to the present moment.
- **Role in CP:** Supports awareness, focus, and grounding through practices like meditation and breathwork.
- **AL Connection:** Enhances ability to notice, focus, and sustain attention in digital contexts.
- **Benefits:** Improves focus, reduces anxiety, and fosters deeper learning engagement.

## Methodology

- **Design:** Concepts drawn from a three-round Delphi study with CP practitioners.
- **Data:** Expert input from global educators (n=7 initially, n=6 completed).
- **Approach:** Consensus on integrating mindfulness into AL frameworks.

## Concepts

- **Mindfulness:** Mental capacity for intentional, present-focused attention.
- **Contemplative Pedagogy (CP):** Educational approach using mindfulness to cultivate presence.
- **Attentional Literacy (AL):** Skill of managing attention, supported by mindfulness.

## Notes
