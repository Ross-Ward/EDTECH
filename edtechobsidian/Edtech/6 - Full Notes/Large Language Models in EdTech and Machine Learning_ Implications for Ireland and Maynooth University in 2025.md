## 1. Introduction

The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has reshaped artificial intelligence, enabling applications in natural language processing, task automation, and education [Brown et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165). However, recent studies reveal significant variability in LLMs’ mathematical reasoning capabilities, raising critical questions for their application in Educational Technology (EdTech) and machine learning. A Stanford University study, “Large Language Models and Numberland” [Stanford, 2025], found that LLMs, such as the 01 model, achieved high accuracy in the “24” game, surpassing human performance, likely due to targeted training. In contrast, a collaborative study by researchers from Ethereum, Zurich, MathArena, and Sophia University, titled “Proof or Bluff: Evaluating LLMs on a 2025 USA Math Olympiad” [Ethereum et al., 2025], reported dismal scores (1–2%) on novel mathematical problems, underscoring limitations in generalization.

Ireland, a global leader in AI innovation, is uniquely positioned to address these challenges. With a robust AI ecosystem supported by institutions like Maynooth University and research centers such as the ADAPT Centre, Ireland aims to become a global AI powerhouse by 2030 [Digital Strategy Ireland, 2025](https://digitalstrategy.ie/).
