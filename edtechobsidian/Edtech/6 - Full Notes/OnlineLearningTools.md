## Summary
Online learning tools, such as discussion forums and shared documents (e.g., Google Docs), enhance education by enabling collaboration, reducing isolation, and supporting diverse learning needs. Fanguy et al. (2023) demonstrate their efficacy in flipped classrooms.

## Key Points
- **Discussion Forums:** Foster idea exchange, community building, and feedback (Hew, 2015).
- **Collaborative Note-Taking:** Shares cognitive load, improving retention and performance (Orndorff, 2015).
- **Evidence:** Both tools improve writing scores in flipped contexts (Fanguy et al., 2023).
- **Features:** Real-time editing, commenting, and accessibility enhance interaction.

## Concepts
- **Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL):** Technology amplifies group learning (Koehler et al., 2013).
- **Asynchronous Learning:** Flexible participation suits varied schedules.

## Notes
- Limitation: Success relies on instructor facilitation and student engagement.
