## Summary
Online learning faces challenges like reduced interaction and technical issues. Ilham (2023) identifies these as barriers to educational quality at Makassar State University.
Online learning poses challenges like isolation and tech demands. Cavaliero et al. (n.d.) highlight time and tech grappling in graphic facilitation training.
## Key Points
- **Interaction:** Limited to secondary contact (Ilham, 2023).
- **Technical:** Network disruptions hinder communication (Muninggar et al., 2021).
- **Distractions:** Games divert focus (Ilham, 2023).
- **Workload:** Task overload reduces motivation.
- - **Isolation:** Common in online settings (Bawa, 2016). 
- **Tech:** Learning tools (Sway, Miro) burdensome (Cavaliero et al., n.d.). 
- **Time:** Processing new skills takes effort. 
- **Attrition:** Higher in online programs.

## Concepts
- **Digital Divide:** Access impacts efficacy.
- **Engagement Loss:** Less direct contact weakens learning.
- **Digital Literacy:** Skill barrier. 
- **Engagement Loss:** Reduced interaction risk.
