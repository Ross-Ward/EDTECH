**Abstract**

This research examines how Large language models(LLM)- Augment Low-Code/No-Code (LCNC) environments function as distributed cognitive systems( Edwin Hutchins,1995) that fundamentally reshape the process of development for for novice and intermediate learners. From a theoretical lens of distributed cognition, this study which represents a transformation in human-LLM-LCNC assemblage as a single cognitive unit which propagates knowledge to jointly accomplish tasks for the learner through visual interfaces and underlying AI agents. These findings carry direct implications for the design of future AI-augmented programming environments, curriculum policy in higher education, and our theoretical understanding of how cognition is redistributed when increasingly performant agents are integrated into the developmental loop.
