# Brainstorming a New EdTech Intervention Paper

This document outlines the initial ideas for a research paper on an EdTech intervention. It uses the structure from "Evolving Educational Practices through Targeted EdTech Interventions" as a guiding framework.

### 1. **Introduction**

*   **Focus:** Evolutionary, not revolutionary change.
*   **Core Idea:** Build upon existing, successful teaching practices while integrating a specific, targeted EdTech intervention.
*   **Grounding:** The intervention will be based on a combination of literature, practical classroom experience, and data-driven insights.
*   **Word Cloud Idea:** *Evolution, Integration, Practical, Data-Informed, Enhancement*

### 2. **Problem Statement**

*   **The Gap:** There's a disconnect between the availability of EdTech tools and their effective pedagogical use, especially for foundational concepts in computer science.
*   **The Issue:** First-year computer science students often struggle with abstract concepts. While many tools exist, they are often not used in a way that provides real-time feedback or personalizes the learning journey.
*   **Word Cloud Idea:** *Gap, Ineffective, Underutilized, Abstract, Foundational*

### 3. **Importance of the Problem**

*   **Context:** The success of students in computer science programs often hinges on their grasp of initial, foundational topics.
*   **The Risk:** Without effective early interventions, we risk higher dropout rates and a weaker overall understanding of core principles.
*   **The Goal:** To ensure that the technology we use actively contributes to building a strong conceptual foundation for students.
*   **Word Cloud Idea:** *Foundation, Retention, Core-Principles, Attrition, Engagement*

### 4. **Literature Review**

*   **Focus:** Review literature on cognitive load in introductory programming, the use of automated feedback systems, and personalized learning paths in STEM.
*   **Key Themes:** Teacher agency, student-centered design, immediate feedback loops, and scaffolding complex topics.
*   **Word Cloud Idea:** *Cognitive-Load, Scaffolding, Feedback-Loops, Personalization, STEM-Education*

### 5. **Proposed Intervention**

*   **The Tool:** A web-based platform that provides interactive, visual simulations of core computer science concepts (e.g., data structures, algorithms).
*   **Features:**
    *   Personalized problem sets based on initial diagnostic quizzes.
    *   Immediate, visual feedback on code execution.
    *   A dashboard for lecturers to track common misconceptions and areas of struggle.
*   **Test Group:** Incoming first-year Computer Science students.
*   **Word Cloud Idea:** *Interactive, Visualization, Simulation, Personalized-Paths, Real-Time-Feedback*

### 6. **How Does My Intervention Address the Issue?**

*   **Visibility:** The dashboard will make student and cohort-level difficulties visible to instructors.
*   **Fixes the Problem:** It provides targeted practice and visual aids to help students overcome specific conceptual hurdles.
*   **Informed Decision-Making:** Allows instructors to adapt their teaching based on real-time data from the platform.
*   **Word Cloud Idea:** *Targeted-Practice, Data-Driven, Adaptive-Teaching, Visualization, Insight*

### 7. **Data Collection Plan**

*   **Quantitative:**
    *   Time spent on platform.
    *   Number of attempts per problem.
    *   Scores on diagnostic and summative quizzes.
    *   Platform usage logs (feature interaction).
*   **Qualitative:**
    *   Surveys on student confidence and perceived understanding.
    *   Focus group interviews with a subset of students.
    *   Instructor reflections on how the tool influenced their teaching.
*   **Word Cloud Idea:** *Metrics, Usage-Logs, Confidence-Levels, Perceptions, Reflections*

### 8. **How Will I Measure Impact?**

*   **Comparison:** Pre- and post-intervention analysis of exam scores and assignment grades.
*   **Surveys:** Measure changes in student attitudes towards computer science.
*   **Analytics:** Correlate platform usage with academic performance.
*   **Word Cloud Idea:** *Correlation, Performance, Attitude-Shift, Engagement-Metrics, Impact*

### 9. **Analysis Plan**

*   **For Students:** Identify patterns in platform use that correlate with success. Do students who use the visual simulations perform better?
*   **For Teachers:** How did the dashboard change how they prepared for lectures or tutorials?
*   **For EdTech Efficacy:** Did the tool help students grasp concepts that are traditionally difficult?
*   **Word Cloud Idea:** *Patterns, Correlations, Efficacy, Teacher-Behavior, Student-Success*

### 10. **Has It Made a Difference?**

*   **Success Metrics:**
    *   Measurable improvement in grades for topics covered by the tool.
    *   Increased student confidence reported in surveys.
    *   Positive feedback from instructors on the tool's utility.
*   **Word Cloud Idea:** *Improvement, Confidence, Utility, Positive-Feedback, Success*

### 11. **Generalization to Capstone Data & Future Projects**

*   **Scalability:** The framework can be applied to other courses or departments.
*   **Future Work:** The platform could be expanded to include more advanced topics or integrated with the university's LMS.
*   **Word Cloud Idea:** *Scalable, Replicable, Extensible, Integration, Future-Work*
