## Abstract

Students of all academic levels within higher education struggle with academic planning, time management and resource coordination; particularly during their final years as students when capstone projects are presented. Traditional planning systems often lack, empathy, personalization, transparency or actionable guidelines which contributes to stress, missed deadlines and disengagement. This proposal explores planning with AI-- by combining Large language models, constraint satisfaction programming and agentic software focusing on student needs. This approach can assist students in building conflict-free, personalized project schedules empowering students with brainstorming, time-line generation, risk-free mitigation and team/supervisor coordination specifically tailored to the individual needs, goals and skills require by the large commitment of a capstone project within software development educational systems.  
Aiming to design through engagement metrics, schedule efficiency and academic performance, this research and study will invest age the pedagogical and ethical implications of using LLMs to support academic learning while proposing responsible ethical implementations.

## 1. Problem Statement

The persistent challenge of planning and time management within higher education show that students frequently encounter scheduling conflicts, lack of drive or direction, or poor alignment between academic task and personal commitments. This is particularly evident in final year capstone projects within computer science programs, which usually require high level technical skills, demanding levels of coordinatization and far sight through long term planning.  
Many academics and students lack structured guidance when setting goals, selecting technology or tools and while breaking down complex project requirements into achievable manageable milestones. Most existing tools fall short: as they're generic, poorly integrated or not specifically designed for a project based learning approach. Recent studies show that 40% of students report schedule conflicts that hinder academic planning (Ellucian, 2023) and up to 35% take irrelevant or misaligned courses due to unclear planning of future goals. (Zawacki-Richter et al, 2019). This commonly results in increased negative affects on student mental health, which generally is a leading cause of poor or hindered academic outcomes or unfortunately disengagement entirely.

## 2. Significance of the Problem

As large language models (LLMs) demonstrate increasingly sophisticated language understanding capabilities, they offer transformative potential for educational technology, particularly in developing more responsive intelligent tutoring systems” (Naderi, 2025)
A cornerstone of effective pedagogical intervention is planning for academic success, intuitions and researchers recognize the need for digital tools which support structured, personalized guidance work, yet most tools fail to meet the growing needs of students- particularly for capstone project where sound, ethical, individualized support is needed most. “With a focus on engineering education, this framework can be adapted to other project-based learning contexts, where educators can pick and choose the relevant implementation items as needed” (Nikolic et al., 2025)

### Impacts

- **Students**: Increased stress, missed deadlines, lower performance.
- **Faculty**: Greater administrative burden, inefficient support systems.
- **Institutions**: Higher dropout rates, lower retention, reduced educational impact.

Poor planning has been shown to directly affect students. A report published by the Higher Education Authority (HEA) found that 40% of Irish universities showed high levels of stress due to academic pressures, exacerbated by insufficient access to counseling services, which are often underfunded and overstretched (source: HEA, Student Mental Health and Wellbeing Report, 2023). While a survey by Union of students in Ireland (USI) reported 1 in 3 of students struggled with deadlines due to poor communication of course requirements and limited access to academic advisors particularly the Larger institutions.(USI, National Student Survey, 2022).

“By extending existing models with constructs such as AI literacy, prompt-crafting competence, and epistemic verification protocols, this research offers a theoretically grounded and practically actionable roadmap for embedding AI in STEM teacher preparation” (Mohammadipour, 2024).
Irish Universities face increasingly more administrative burden due to improper institutional planning, understaffing, outdated legacy system. A 2022 Irish federation of University Teachers report highlighted faculty at larger institutions spend up to 20% of their time on administrative tasks due to inadequate support systems and inefficient digital learning platforms, reducing time for teaching and research (IFUT, Faculty Workload Survey,2022). Among even tertiary education sectors a student ratio of 23:1 can be seen which according to The Education And Training Monitor Report 2023. A figure seen to be one of the highest in Europe and known to increase workload pressures and limit faculty ability to provide proper personal student support. These affects are compounded, an average 15% of first year student (with up to 20%) in STEM courses due to inadequate academic support and poor course planning (HEA, Progression and Retention in Irish Higher Education, 2024).

Ireland's underinvestment in higher education according to a 2019 OECD study directly correlates to sever educational impacts for student and for universities in areas like retention and negatively performing rankings at a global level, This along with delays in modernization of curricula and slow adaptation of interdisciplinary programs impact the systemic shortfalls within Irish Universities.

## 4. Research Objective

The objective of this research is to design, develop, and evaluate the effectiveness of AI planning agents focusing on computer science and the management of capstone/final year projects.  
An overall goal of providing open-source, transparent, privacy conscious software that assist in personalized timeline generation and milestones, using LLMs to identify skill-gap and recommend resources to assist students allowing them to identify risks and dynamically plan and coordinate their projects (Alone or with a group).

## 4.1 Proposed Research Questions

I propose main questions on 4 topics:

Compare the performance of regular paid models vs Fine Tuned LORA?

Do these tools actually help students?

Can any student take this software and adjust and fine-tune it for specific project needs?

Is this software negatively affecting the user in any way or performance metric?

Are agents feasible for Educational technology software development

## 5. Proposed Interventions

Planning tools for CS students combining the Agentic programming, constraint satisfaction programming (CSP) and large language models (LLMs) allowing these tools to generate conflict free timelines for Final Year Projects which will include timelines, milestones, resource suggestion and risk identification. This along with the ability to adjust personal commitments and availability to properly provide explainable preferable recommendations that enhance transparency, trust, and overall academic performance by allowing students to hit the ground running, these tools are recommended for final year student. But similar interventions can be modified for specific use cases such as:

### 5.1 Applications of AI Planning

AI can recommend courses and build conflict-free schedules tailored to each student’s goals and constraints. For example, “intelligent course recommendation” engines use machine learning to suggest courses that a student will likely succeed in, keeping them on track for graduation. Scheduling tools analyze course offerings, prerequisites, and student commitments (jobs, labs, etc.) to propose optimal timetables. A recent tool, **TRACE-cs** (from Washington University), combines symbolic planning with LLMs to generate student course schedules and **explain** its choices. TRACE-cs can answer questions like _“Why was course X selected over course Y?”_ based on encoded constraints. In testing, TRACE-cs achieved 100% correctness in its scheduling explanations (versus ~45–50% for LLM-only methods) by integrating user input and LLM refinement. Most if not all computer science students must complete a final year project or capstone project.

### 5.2 Final Year Project Initial Planning

“Findings provide key insights that can inform faculty pedagogy, course design, campus policies, and strategic integration of AI” (Mohandas & Mentzer, 2024). Tools similar in nature such as “planners can leverage ChatGPT’s capabilities to retrieve and consolidate planning knowledge, analyze data, develop predictive models, provide decision support, and facilitate scenario planning” (Peng et al., 2023)
#### Brainstorming

AI tools can play a major role in assisting advisors and students with structuring their FYP/Capstone project. These early planning stages are crucial for fully understanding your deadlines and requirements correctly so the project does fail. Using LLMs or specific agentic tools dedicated to planning allows students to use "AI automation can enhance educational outcomes through personalized content delivery and interactive support mechanisms”(Gotavade, 2025)

#### Timeline Generation
“Time constraints within a master’s program… limit the scope of transformative learning experiences” (Kostanyan & Fortino, 2025).
Consider and example, a student can define deliverables, set milestones and preemptively generate sources, fitting their specific requirements. The tools can break each project into phases and plan each estimated time, and output Gantt-style schedules or weekly breakdowns of plans.

#### Risk Identification and Replanning

One of the most important reasons for using a tool such as this is the ability to identify risk, bottlenecks and specific ways you may be limited when developing. In this case these tools generally offer contingency plans or replan when a student has fallen behind.

### 5.3 Group Project Planning

#### Role and Task Assignment

Each software student usually has a group project, which for new developers and engineers can be an extremely daunting task, as with improper management, and unclear team structure, software development methodologies (Like agile development or waterfall method) can be over looked which can negatively affect the team and lead to potential difficulties as the project progresses.

#### Milestone Planning and Synchronization

Some of these issues, could be solved with the implementation of a tool which assists teams, by planning their scrums, assigning roles, and dividing work optimally, so each members skills and strengths are taken advantage of and nobody is left behind. Rather than team members unsure on who does what, These tools allow students to actively focus on what is deliverable, rather than what is not.

#### Progress Monitoring and Alerting

Although some tools may offer this as a MS Planner plugin or a Enhanced Asana. This can be used to effectively manage resources.

### 5.4 Personal Project Planning

For **individual students** doing solo projects or independent study:

#### AI-Generated Roadmaps

AI planning tools can:

- Generate a complete **step-by-step roadmap** for project execution.
- Recommend tutorials, datasets, or libraries based on project type.

**Example:**

> **Project:** “Build a personal budgeting app”  
> **AI Plan:**
> 
> - Week 1–2: UX research + wireframes
> - Week 3–4: Learn React Native
> - Week 5–8: Code core app features
> - Week 9: Test with users
> - Week 10: Polish UI and finalize

#### Self-Assessment & Skill Mapping

AI agents can:

- Evaluate a student’s readiness by mapping required skills (e.g., Firebase, JavaScript).
- Suggest learning modules before development begins.

**Example:**

> “You’re missing database experience. Recommended: Do Firebase Crash Course before Week 3.”

#### Solo Workflow Automation

AI integrations in tools like Notion, Obsidian, or Monday.com can:

- Automate progress tracking.
- Link notes, todos, and code commits for self-monitoring.

The use of AI at all levels  "planning generates tailored routes… monitoring it, checking its current progress and acting when discrepancies appear” (Garrido et al., 2012) supporting the opportunity for modifying specifically for use through agents.

## 6. Ethical and Pedagogical Implications

Delegating planning tasks to AI has deep implications. Ethically, concerns include data privacy (AI systems need student and faculty data), bias (recommendations must not reinforce inequalities), and transparency.  “By fostering a dialogue with faculty… ensure that technological advancements align with the foundational values of education: integrity, inclusivity, and academic excellence” (Miller, 2024)
Pedagogically, one must consider whether students lose agency or learning by outsourcing planning. Some argue AI can free students from logistical burden so they can focus on learning; others worry about over-reliance. A balanced view is reflected in the motto: _“It’s not whether AI is greater than you. It’s whether you plus AI is greater than you.”_.  
In other words, the goal is human–AI synergy. AI can suggest and optimize, but educators and students remain responsible for final decisions and ethical judgment. The _epistemological_ question (how knowledge is constructed) also arises: if AI chooses courses or content, whose definition of “important knowledge” is being followed? Ensuring diverse input into the AI’s design and keeping humans in control helps address this.

## 7. Research Methodology

### 7.1 Participants

- Final-year undergraduate CS students (n ≈ 30–50)
- Project supervisors and academic advisors (qualitative input)

### 7.2 Phases

1. **Tool Prototyping** (with open-source CSP + LLM framework)
2. **Pilot Deployment** (6–8 weeks of project support)
3. **Data Collection** (see below)

## 8. Data Collection Plan

These interventions should allow the collection of Qualitative by measuring the efficiency of scheduling with these tools, possibly with the percentage of conflict-free schedules or the amount of time saved to be used valuably else where. It could also be possible to establish a milestone completion rate system which at each milestone engagement metrics such as time on task or tool interaction frequency could be monitored. Finally the most accurate indicator i would say, academic performance and the overall quality of projects being created.  
Along with this data, Quantitative data must also be collected this could be through surveys, possibly on the usability of tools and engagements with them. Personal interviews on time subjects who saved time or their teaching/learning methodologies have improved or being impacted, and more importantly discussions between focus groups which can help improve trust and ethical concerns allowing the impact of this project to be effectively measured.

## 9. Impact Measurement

The perspective impact of these interventions should be comprised of comparisons of engagement, performance, project quality and success rates, initial preintervention, through possible surveys and interviews which will assist in the visualization of perceptions of Agentic tool learning space. Each tool should have suggested analytics which log data, recommendations and acceptance rates measuring the efficacy.

## 10. Analysis Plan

It would be beneficial, to assist users and educators through the use of analysis on engagement patterns, academic performance and assess any possible improvements on completion rates of FYP Students which would intern allow for the evaluation of time saved for faculty. This along with recommendations on changes of teaching practice may allow for tool efficacy to be compared to intended outcomes when comparing expected results and actual results overall, while highlighting transparency and fairness.

## 11. Expected Outcomes

Highlighting these problems, it may be probable that software developed using agentic tools have the ability, with proper implementation, to successfully increase student engagement. By personalizing planning and student information acquisition with hopes to improve academic performance and FYP Success rates by efficiently enhancing student and faculty efficiency while reducing administrative burdens. These tools along with many other tools could be implemented to deploy sustainable change through scalable transparent agentic AI Tools.

## 12. Generalization of These Tools for Future Projects

This intervention model with successful implementation could be adapted rapidly, easily and scalable to other disciplines or institutions, which would allow these tools to be applied to different academic programs, projects and scenarios. Generalization of these tools could promote the assistance of scaling data collection for larger cohorts and inform its findings to institutional policy makers to promote the adaptation of this intervention.
