# 📚 Exploring Particle Swarm Optimization to Enhance Learning Efficiency in Software Engineering Courses - Research Summary

# **Methodology**

## **1. Research Design**

This study employs a **mixed-methods of experimental design** to evaluate the effectiveness of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) as a pedagogical accelerator in Software Engineering education. Two student groups are compared:

- **Control Group:** Completes an optimization-related software engineering task manually.
    
- **Experimental Group:** Completes the same task using a PSO-supported tool.
    

Both groups complete standardized assessments before and after the intervention, along with performance tasks and cognitive load measures. Qualitative reflections are collected to complement quantitative results.

## **2. Participants**

Participants are undergraduate Software Engineering or Computer Science students enrolled in a third-year course. Students are assigned to groups based on existing class sections to avoid scheduling conflicts, following a quasi-experimental structure.


# **3. Data Collection**

## **3.1 Collection Methods**

Data is collected using four channels:

1. **Pre-test and Post-test:** Measures conceptual understanding of optimization and software engineering problem-solving before and after the intervention.
    
2. **Performance Task:** Students complete an SE problem (e.g., test case generation, scheduling, or resource allocation) either manually or with PSO.
    
3. **Surveys:**
    
    - **NASA-TLX** for cognitive load
        
    - Short reflective questionnaire for student perceptions
        
4. **Logging Data:** IDE or tool timestamps are used to record task duration.

## 📊 Methodology
Anchor the study around specific measurable pedagogical tools:
Concept : Concept Inventory - 1Q : Does the user have learning gain more learning gain using agents using specific swarm design patterns vs traditional.
Pre-test/Post-test -> Performance Rubric -> NASA-TLX Cognitive Load Survey
The aim is to gain valuable insight into student learning gain, performance quality, student cognitive load and overall student perception of learning through Agentic software design.
### Data Collection
This will involve a mixed approach with experimental design solutions in which we give students tools involving two types of tools.
Control group : Can be assisted with or without using traditional LLM or agent
Experimental group : Uses LLM Tool specifically trained and optimized by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)

Both groups Use Pre-test, Treatment and post-test with performance task scored using a standardized rubric, students cognitive load will be tested using a NASA-TLX instrument with short open-ended reflections 

### **1. Collection Methods**

- **Pre-test/Post-test administration** (measures learning gain)
- **Performance task execution** (code/design task solved manually or with PSO)
- **Rubric-based scoring** by two independent evaluators
- **NASA-TLX cognitive load survey** (Likert)
- **Short reflection questionnaire** (qualitative insights)
- **Optional:** System logs for time-on-task
