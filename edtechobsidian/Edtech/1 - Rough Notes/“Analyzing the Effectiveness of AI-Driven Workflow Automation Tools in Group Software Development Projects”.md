**What to measure:**

- Workflow time reduction
    
- Automation success rate
    
- Student perceptions
    

**Why:**

- Low-code automation (like n8n) is under-researched academically.
### **What this study investigates**

- How tools like _n8n, Zapier, Retool, Appsmith, Budibase_ (or your custom system) help students automate:
    
    - integrations
        
    - data flows
        
    - backend tasks
        
    - API pipelines
### **Why this matters**

- Workflow automation is essential in DevOps & modern software stacks
    
- Students often struggle with integration + backend wiring
    
- AI-assisted automation tools may drastically reduce debugging and config errors
### **Relevant Theories**

- **Distributed Cognition** (AI taking part of cognitive work)
    
- **Activity Theory** (tools mediating human activity)
    
- **Socio-Technical Systems Theory**

|Construct|Metric / Instrument|
|---|---|
|Integration Success|Error rates, failed API calls|
|Development Speed|Time to implement automation|
|Quality|Correctness of workflow logic|
|Usability|SUS (System Usability Scale)|
|Student Experience|Reflections + interviews|
### **Methodology**

- **Experimental design** (manual workflow vs AI-automated workflow)
    
- Performance benchmarking
    
- Qualitative follow-up interviews

Shows whether AI automation reduces integration friction — one of the largest bottlenecks in student group projects.
