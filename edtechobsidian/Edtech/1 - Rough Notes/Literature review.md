Capstone projects in software development programmes play a critical role in achieving learning milestones by bridging the gaps between academic theory and real-world software development practices. For students these projects require extreme care and dedication and demonstrate skills and proficiency in all areas of software design and engineering through project planning, time management, task delegation, research and documentation through self-directed learning experiences. As AI emerges more prominently within the educational technology space, tools providing intelligent personalised support for these types of projects assist students throughout the projects lifecycle. This review explores the applicability of these tools in all aspects of project management, identifying common gaps and directions which support project and tool development.

Current research focuses on project-based ideation and planning rather than specific capstone assistance tools. Largely these tools are built with paid models and APIs, but recently a lot of the research coming from the USA and China is using open-source free models that are run locally and fine-tuned specifically for the tasks at hand. AI has transformed various facets of education and teaching for the better, streamlining administrative tasks and personalising feedback by adapting to each individual student's project requirements. This, combined with complex research and experimental development processes, enables capstone projects for students to be easily planned (San Diego University 2024). Similarly, through agentic chatbots such as Mainstay, student queries and questions are handled quickly, facilitating project development and management as a whole.

The focus of my research will be specifically Capstone Projects, although there have been significant advancements through AI project management. which is highlighted in the works of Müller et al. (2024), acknowledging that AI enhances project management through machine learning and assists with the application of decision-making frameworks. The student may not be aware of optimising resource utilisation.

Several sources directly address the integration of AI tools in capstone projects, providing concrete examples of their application for students, such as the work done by the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE), highlighting which trauma-informed chatbots for education are incorporated into capstone projects. These projects and tools used natural language processing to create engaging lesson plans and promote AI literacy, which assisted in students critical thinking, demonstrating how embedded AI can be used in educational projects.

Similar research from the British Educational Research Association helps provide tools that integrate generative AI into capstone projects through tools like Connected Papers, Consensus and Elicit, which assist students in locating relevant academic papers, providing structure and assistance through the research phase of capstone project development. This study showed that 100% of students found these enhancements valuable to their overall learning experiences, underscoring their need and effectiveness.

Along with this research, Mercer University's Stetson-Hatcher School of Business, an MBA capstone course, uses AI (GPT) within its management simulations, which was shown to enhance strategic decision-making (AACSB 2024). This allowed students to visualise market scenarios, make data-driven decisions and improve their problem-solving skills with the assistance of AI through communication and data visualisation.

Case studies on the impact of AI on educational project management have been conducted at the Georgia Institute of Technology, built using IBM Watson as a base and specifically fine-tuned, which allowed it to resolve 97% of student queries, showing their potential to support real-time projects. (digital LEARNING INSTITUTE).

Despite all the benefits, integrating AI can present challenges. Igbokwe (2023) identifies 5 key issues commonly seen when implementing AI, such as lack of ethical and legal guidelines, technical expertise, job displacement fears, interoperability issues and, most importantly, overreliance on AI. These challenges are relevant, more so in educational settings where capstone projects are concerned, as the goal of the project is to highlight, challenge and stimulate the students educational interests. If a student becomes over-reliant, academic integrity and equitable access can be paramount. The BERA study emphasises the need for responsible and ethical AI use, ensuring it enhances their learning experience and outcomes rather than bypassing it.

With hope my research focuses on developing an educational assistance framework for students through education and development of these tools using open-source free technology and software, which will allow me to address ethical concerns and evaluate long-term impacts of student outcomes. A prediction by Gartner suggests that by 2030 70%+ of project management will be tasked to AI, which suggests a possible transformative future for further exploration into AI's role in capstone project development.
