**What to measure:**

- TAM model (Technology Acceptance Model)
    
- Perceived usefulness, ease of use
    
- Adoption intentions
    

### **What this study investigates**

- How students perceive AI-enhanced tools during coursework
    
- Whether they trust and adopt AI assistance
    
- Whether low-code tools feel limiting or empowering
    

###  **Why this matters**

- Even the best tools fail if users reject or misunderstand them
    
- This helps universities plan curricular adoption
    
- Reveals psychological + behavioral barriers
    

###  **Relevant Theories**

-  **Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)**
    
    - Perceived Usefulness (PU)
        
    - Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU)
        
    - Behavioral Intention (BI)
        
-  **UTAUT or UTAUT2** (if you want extended factors)
    
-  **Self-Efficacy Theory**
|Construct|Instrument|
|---|---|
|PU, PEOU, BI|TAM-based Likert questionnaire|
|Trust in AI|AI Trust Scale|
|Satisfaction|CSAT|
|Barriers|Interviews / focus groups|

### **Methodology**

- **Quantitative survey** (TAM-based)
    
- **Qualitative interviews** for deeper insight
    
- Best suited as **a correlational study** or **survey research**
