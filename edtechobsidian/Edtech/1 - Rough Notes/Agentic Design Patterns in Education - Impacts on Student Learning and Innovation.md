This study explores the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in an educational context and its impact on data-driven decision-making related to student engagement, academic success, and creativity. Contextually, considering the necessity of utilization AI tools in education as a predominant factor in educational practice, this research provides full-fledged knowledge and approach on the overall implementation and significance of AI tools using hypothetical situation evidence (background materials), which are required to understand their prominence. We use a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative analysis of institutional records and surveys capturing student engagement, academic performance and innovative thinking pre-post AI implementation with qualitative case studies which provide detailed insights into how AI tools can be implemented effectively in educational settings. This study is based on secondary data source, major publications available in the Scopus database related to AI in education. Search terms for data search were "Artificial Intelligence in Education," "AI-driven tools," "Impact of AI on classroom dynamics", "Personalized learning", "Educational technology, AI, and creativity in education", Critical thinking in the classroom, Adaptive learning systems), intelligent tutoring systems)." Student engagement. The results demonstrate significant gains in multiple metrics, with engagement scores increasing by 20–23%, GPA from 9% to 14%, and innovative thinking skills levels swelling from 44% to 57%. About 65%-75% of teacher surveys indicated a positive impact of AI on teaching and learning. The study also notes constraints including confounding whereby the inability to control for factors that may affect odds of innovative thinking and conceptualization in measuring innovative thinking. This is role, it should also advocate for longitudinal inquiries, establish standardized ways of assessing, and be analytical about the ethical implications raised by AI in education. Overall, this study underscores that AI has considerable potential to improve educational achievement and the necessity of systematic research in order to actualize its benefits. This study reinforces the possibility of AI making a big difference in improving educational results. As such, it illuminates the importance of systematic investigations into AI´s function in education to obtain full knowledge on how best to take advantage.
