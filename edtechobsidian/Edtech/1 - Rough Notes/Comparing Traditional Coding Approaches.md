## **“Comparing Traditional Coding Approaches and AI-Assisted Low-Code Design in Undergraduate Group Projects”**
**What to study:**
- Time-on-task 
- Code quality rubric
- Team cohesion  
- Final project usability    
### **What this study investigates**
- How student teams perform **using traditional coding** (VS Code, GitHub, manual UI design)  
    **vs.** 
- How they perform **using AI-assisted low-code environments** (AI UI builders, workflow generators, drag-and-drop design)
### **Why this matters**
- AI-assisted tools are entering real industry pipelines  
- Universities need evidence of their impact on learning and skill acquisition 
- Teams behave differently depending on tool complexity
### **Relevant Theories**
- **Cognitive Load Theory** 
- **Constructivism** (learning through doing) 
- **Collaborative Learning Theory** 
- **Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)** (optional)
|Construct|Metric / Instrument|
|---|---|
|Productivity|Time-on-task, velocity, story-point completion|
|Learning|Pre/post tests, concept inventory|
|Quality|Rubric: maintainability, correctness, usability|
|Teamwork|Git commits, merge conflicts, task distribution|
|Cognitive Load|NASA-TLX|
- **Mixed methods** 
- **Quasi-experimental groups**  
- Control = traditional coding  
- Experimental = AI-assisted low-code
- 4–5 week study
Provides empirical evidence on the trade-off between **traditional programming mastery** and **accelerated development using AI tools**.
