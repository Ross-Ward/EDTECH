*Abstract*
This study investigates the impact of LLM-Augmented Low-Code/No-Code (LCNC) development environments on the acquisition of durable and affective programming fluency and conceptual retention and applicability. Traditionally, novice and lower-intermediate undergraduate learners struggle bridging the gap between High-level programming concepts and practical implementations in code. LCNC Platforms offer users the ability to apply these concepts through computational artifacts, visual metaphors and natural language instruction through incremental guidance even before a learner has full information standing on the topic. This research will approach controlled designs across multiple software applications which has the possibility of improving introductory programming fluency and its curriculum which is usually delivered through manual coding and lectures format.  Throughout this study we will test, command line LLM interfaces such as Claude code and Gemini cli, LLM-Augmented LCNC Platforms like V0, Loveable and Rork to name a few, LLM augmented automation tools such as N8N / Zapier and finally LLM Augmented programming environments such as Cursor and Kiro. These tools will assist our findings  and our primary outcome would include Code-Writing Fluency, Code-reading and debugging processionary and finally conceptual knowledge which will be test prior to use of said tools and after, with hopes of reducing the dependency of up and coming programmers on LLMs and improving self-efficacy through introduction of design patterns and agentic design patterns and workflows.
