## Synthesis

The compiled quotes and references provide a comprehensive foundation for developing an AI-driven capstone planning tool, emphasizing automation, personalization, and ethical integration across various domains. The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) and frameworks like LoRA (Quotes 1-2) enables efficient adaptation of AI models for capstone planning, reducing computational demands while tailoring solutions to specific project needs. Ethical considerations (Quotes 4-5) highlight the importance of teaching students to critically engage with AI outputs, ensuring capstone projects align with academic integrity and equitable outcomes. Frameworks such as TPACK (Quotes 7-8, 20) and SOEI (Quotes 77-79) offer structured approaches for embedding AI into educational planning, supporting the design of adaptive, scenario-based capstone activities that account for diverse learner needs. The use of agile methodologies like Scrum and Kanban (Quotes 48, 61) and tools like PBL Studio (Quote 52) underscores the potential for AI to streamline iterative planning and reflective ideation, enhancing project efficiency. Additionally, the automation of tasks such as literature synthesis (Quotes 73-75), project charters (Quote 63), and tailored learning routes (Quotes 66-67) demonstrates AI’s capability to manage complex capstone components, from milestone tracking to knowledge integration. Computational thinking (Quotes 38-39) and scenario planning (Quote 35) further support structured decision-making, while time constraints (Quotes 41, 44, 50) emphasize the need for AI to optimize schedules in resource-limited environments. Recent advancements like NCAL (Quotes 81-83) address long-tail challenges in personalized learning, improving robustness for capstone guidance. Extensions such as BoRA (Quotes 85-87) enhance symmetrical fine-tuning for balanced adaptations, and LoRA applications in cultural heritage (Quotes 89-91) enable generation of detailed designs for interdisciplinary projects. Self-directed AI ecosystems (Quotes 93-95) promote autonomous learning with customized roadmaps, while LoRA-fine-tuned LLMs (Quotes 97-99) excel in analyzing collaborative argumentation for team-based capstones. QLoRA techniques (Quotes 101-103) facilitate quality question generation for capstone assessments. Collectively, these insights suggest that an AI-driven capstone planning tool can leverage LLMs, fine-tuning, and structured frameworks to create adaptive, efficient, and ethically grounded plans, ultimately enhancing the quality and scalability of capstone project execution.
