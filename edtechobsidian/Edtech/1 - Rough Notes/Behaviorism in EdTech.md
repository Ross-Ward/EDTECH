# 📚 Behaviorism in Educational Technology

## Overview
Behaviorism in educational technology focuses on observable behaviors and how learning can be shaped through reinforcement, feedback, and structured environments. This approach emphasizes measurable outcomes and systematic instruction.

## Key Principles

### 1. Stimulus-Response
- Learning occurs through associations between stimuli and responses
- Behavior is shaped by environmental factors
- Emphasis on observable outcomes
[[Learning Theories in EdTech]]

### 2. Reinforcement
**Types**:
- Positive reinforcement (rewards)
- Negative reinforcement (removal of obstacles)
- Continuous reinforcement
- Intermittent reinforcement

**EdTech Applications**:
- Achievement badges
- Progress tracking
- Reward systems
- Performance feedback

### 3. Programmed Instruction
**Components**:
- Sequential content presentation
- Immediate feedback
- Self-paced progression
- Mastery requirements
