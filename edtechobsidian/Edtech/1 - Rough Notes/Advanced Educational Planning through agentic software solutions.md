### Abstract
 AI empowers students, by allowing them to more easily define their purpose in the existential void of education; through meaningfully crafting constellations of success like a cosmic navigator. Amidst the chaotic currents of university life, deadlines become dread-lines. Using AI as a planning tool for practical, resilient and ethically chosen plans ensures Students and educators focus on what is controllable. Planning systems ensure, encode goals, constraints and available actions and use algorithms to generate recommendations or example plans.

Consider a void, a specific goal a student has, and Ai tools like the Navigators compass ensuring that ethical stars are respected while adapting the the ever changing cosmic currents of life, university and Education. This gives students and educators the ability to build-conflict free schedules tailored for each persons goals, constraints and commitments. 
### Problem statement
Its well know that most students face scheduling and resources management issues, this can be from conflicts with classes, personal commitments and life requirements or missing classes, these issues lead to students across the world being overwhelming with stress and anxiety,  mostly due to improperly management. Academic planning can be a daunting and difficult task for students who lack proper guidance, on everything from course selection to project planning. Understandably, most students are not Peter Drucker when it comes to their understanding and clarity of mission and outcome, even with external assistance from a University. This usually leads to an underutilization of planning tools that are already available which can sometimes be generic, confusing, and daunting for students while not providing tailored schedules and clear next steps for most effective action. Likely leaving students disengaged as overwhelming deadlines of assignments, project and exams pile up across all  disciplines. These struggles with effective management of objectives, time and resources make it hard for students to properly balance academic, extracurricular, and personal requirements which can negatively affect student outcomes, well-being and mental health, while damaging the overall integrity of internal courses.

### Importance of the problem
Planning and management are a key critical corner stone of modern pedagogical initiative, as it directly and indirectly affects student success and institutional efficiency. Without transparent, structured planning tools, students will continue to struggle when balancing the intricacies of modern student life. Not only will these tools assist students of all academic levels, but with students given the ability to properly manage their resources, which assists faculty by not spending excessive time on administrative tasks. allowing them to focus on more important and critical educational work. Current Research into the topic albeit, not completely comprehensive of the topic would dictate that poorly implemented Edtech failed to improve learning outcomes necessitating targeted interventions using the suggested approach 

### Literature Review 
The challenges of scheduling and academic planning while being overwhelmed by deadlines in higher education are extremely well documented. A 2023 report from Ellucian found 40% of students face scheduling conflicts that disrupt academic progression, and highlight it as a leading cause of stress, anxiety and delayed graduation for students. Similarly another review in 2019 by Zawacki-Richter noted that unclear planning leads to misaligned student outcomes, with 35% of students taking courses irrelevant to their overall degree outcomes and requirements. These issues  exacerbate the struggles with time management reported by UNESCO(2021) which stated poorly coordinated schedules reduce student engagement by up to 25% due to deadline pile-up and lack of personalized guidance.
Current educational technologies often fail to address these problems effectively. Zawacki-Richter et al. (2019) highlight that many EdTech tools lack personalization, resulting in low adoption rates among students who find them confusing or irrelevant. Prinsloo and Slade (2017) argue that transparency and user trust are critical for effective EdTech, yet many tools do not explain their recommendations, further disengaging students.

AI-driven planning tools offer a promising solution. For instance, TRACE-cs, developed at Washington University (2025), combines constraint satisfaction programming (CSP) with large language models (LLMs) to create conflict-free schedules and explain recommendations, achieving 100% correctness in scheduling explanations compared to 45–50% for LLM-only systems. This transparency addresses student mistrust and supports informed decision-making. Luckin et al. (2016) emphasize that AI tools can reduce logistical burdens, allowing students to focus on learning, with studies showing up to 30% increased engagement when administrative tasks are automated. Ghallab et al. (2004) provide a technical foundation for AI planning, noting that CSP and goal-based algorithms can optimize complex schedules by accounting for constraints like course availability and student commitments.

Capstone projects in software development programmes play a critical role in achieving learning milestones by bridging the gaps between academic theory and real-world software development practices. For students these projects require extreme care and dedication and demonstrate skills and proficiency in all areas of software design and engineering through project planning, time management, task delegation, research and documentation through self-directed learning experiences. As AI emerges more prominently within the educational technology space, tools providing intelligent personalised support for these types of projects assist students throughout the projects lifecycle. This review explores the applicability of these tools in all aspects of project management, identifying common gaps and directions which support project and tool development.

Current research focuses on project-based ideation and planning rather than specific capstone assistance tools. Largely these tools are built with paid models and APIs, but recently a lot of the research coming from the USA and China is using open-source free models that are run locally and fine-tuned specifically for the tasks at hand. AI has transformed various facets of education and teaching for the better, streamlining administrative tasks and personalising feedback by adapting to each individual student's project requirements. This, combined with complex research and experimental development processes, enables capstone projects for students to be easily planned (San Diego University 2024). Similarly, through agentic chatbots such as Mainstay, student queries and questions are handled quickly, facilitating project development and management as a whole.

The focus of my research will be specifically Capstone Projects, although there have been significant advancements through AI project management. which is highlighted in the works of Müller et al. (2024), acknowledging that AI enhances project management through machine learning and assists with the application of decision-making frameworks. The student may not be aware of optimising resource utilisation.

Several sources directly address the integration of AI tools in capstone projects, providing concrete examples of their application for students, such as the work done by the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE), highlighting which trauma-informed chatbots for education are incorporated into capstone projects. These projects and tools used natural language processing to create engaging lesson plans and promote AI literacy, which assisted in students critical thinking, demonstrating how embedded AI can be used in educational projects.

Similar research from the British Educational Research Association helps provide tools that integrate generative AI into capstone projects through tools like Connected Papers, Consensus and Elicit, which assist students in locating relevant academic papers, providing structure and assistance through the research phase of capstone project development. This study showed that 100% of students found these enhancements valuable to their overall learning experiences, underscoring their need and effectiveness.

Along with this research, Mercer University's Stetson-Hatcher School of Business, an MBA capstone course, uses AI (GPT) within its management simulations, which was shown to enhance strategic decision-making (AACSB 2024). This allowed students to visualise market scenarios, make data-driven decisions and improve their problem-solving skills with the assistance of AI through communication and data visualisation.

Case studies on the impact of AI on educational project management have been conducted at the Georgia Institute of Technology, built using IBM Watson as a base and specifically fine-tuned, which allowed it to resolve 97% of student queries, showing their potential to support real-time projects. (digital LEARNING INSTITUTE).

Despite all the benefits, integrating AI can present challenges. Igbokwe (2023) identifies 5 key issues commonly seen when implementing AI, such as lack of ethical and legal guidelines, technical expertise, job displacement fears, interoperability issues and, most importantly, overreliance on AI. These challenges are relevant, more so in educational settings where capstone projects are concerned, as the goal of the project is to highlight, challenge and stimulate the students educational interests. If a student becomes over-reliant, academic integrity and equitable access can be paramount. The BERA study emphasises the need for responsible and ethical AI use, ensuring it enhances their learning experience and outcomes rather than bypassing it.

With hope my research focuses on developing an educational assistance framework for students through education and development of these tools using open-source free technology and software, which will allow me to address ethical concerns and evaluate long-term impacts of student outcomes. A prediction by Gartner suggests that by 2030 70%+ of project management will be tasked to AI, which suggests a possible transformative future for further exploration into AI's role in capstone project development.

## Proposed Interventions
Planning tools for CS students combining the Agentic programming, constraint satisfaction programming (CSP) and large language models (LLMs) allowing these tools to generate conflict free timelines for Final Year Projects which will include timelines, milestones, resource suggestion and risk identification. This along with the ability to adjust personal commitments and availability to properly provide explainable preferable recommendations that enhance transparency, trust, and overall academic performance by allowing students to hit the ground running, these tools are recommended for final year student. But similar interventions can be modified for specific use cases such as :
### Applications of AI Planning
AI can recommend courses and build conflict-free schedules tailored to each student’s goals and constraints. For example, “intelligent course recommendation” engines use machine learning to suggest courses that a student will likely succeed in, keeping them on track for graduation .Scheduling tools analyze course offerings, prerequisites, and student commitments (jobs, labs, etc.) to propose optimal timetables. A recent tool, **TRACE-cs** (from Washington University), combines symbolic planning with LLMs to generate student course schedules and **explain** its choices. TRACE-cs can answer questions like _“Why was course X selected over course Y?”_ based on encoded constraints. In testing, TRACE-cs achieved 100% correctness in its scheduling explanations (versus ~45–50% for LLM-only methods) by integrating user input and LLM refinement. Most if not all computer science students must complete a final year project or capstone project.

### ***Final year project initial planning***
*Brainstorming*
Ai tools can play a major role in assisting advisors and students with structuring their FYP/Capstone project, These early planning stages are crucial for fully understanding your deadlines and requirements correctly so the project does fail. Using LLMs or specific agentic tools dedicated to planning allows students to brainstorm ideas and effetely evaluate project feasibility timelines and complexity by defining the tools and problems/objectives that need to be accomplished.
*Timeline Generation*
Consider and example, a student can define deliverables, set milestones and preemptively generate sources, fitting their specific requirements. The tools can break each project into phases and plan each estimated time, and output Gantt-style schedules or weekly breakdowns of plans.
*Risk Identification and replanning*
One of the most important reasons for using a tool such as this is the ability to identify risk, bottlenecks and specific ways you may be limited when developing. In this case these tools generally offer contingency plans or replan when a student has fallen behind.

Group Project planning
*Role and task assignment*
Each software student usually has a group project, which for new developers and engineers can be an extremely daunting task, as with improper management, and unclear team structure, software development methodologies(Like agile development or waterfall method) can be over looked  which can negatively affect the team and lead to potential difficulties as the project progresses.
*Milestone Planning and Synchronization*
Some of these issues, could be solved with the implementation of a tool which assists teams, by planning their scrums, assigning roles, and dividing work optimally, so each members skills and strengths are taken advantage of and nobody is left behind. Rather than team members unsure on who does what, These tools allow students to actively focus on what is deliverable, rather than what is not.
*Progress monitoring and alerting*
Although some tools may offer this as a MS Planner plugin or a Enchanced Asana. This can be used to effectively manage resources.

### Personal Project planning
For **individual students** doing solo projects or independent study:

**AI-Generated Roadmaps**
AI planning tools can:
- Generate a complete **step-by-step roadmap** for project execution.
- Recommend tutorials, datasets, or libraries based on project type.
Example:
> **Project:** “Build a personal budgeting app”  
> **AI Plan:**
>
> - Week 1–2: UX research + wireframes
>     
> - Week 3–4: Learn React Native
>     
> - Week 5–8: Code core app features
>     
> - Week 9: Test with users
>     
> - Week 10: Polish UI and finalize
>     

 **Self-Assessment & Skill Mapping**
AI agents can:
- Evaluate a student’s readiness by mapping required skills (e.g., Firebase, JavaScript).
- Suggest learning modules before development begins.
Example:
> “You’re missing database experience. Recommended: Do Firebase Crash Course before Week 3.”

**Solo Workflow Automation**
AI integrations in tools like Notion, Obsidian, or Monday.com can:
- Automate progress tracking.
- Link notes, todos, and code commits for self-monitoring.
- Generate periodic “status reports” to help maintain accountability.


**Ethical and Pedagogical Implications:** Delegating planning tasks to AI has deep implications. Ethically, concerns include data privacy (AI systems need student and faculty data), bias (recommendations must not reinforce inequalities), and transparency.
Pedagogically, one must consider whether students lose agency or learning by outsourcing planning. Some argue AI can free students from logistical burden so they can focus on learning; others worry about over-reliance. A balanced view is reflected in the motto: _“It’s not whether AI is greater than you. It’s whether you plus AI is greater than you.”_. 
In other words, the goal is human–AI synergy. AI can suggest and optimize, but educators and students remain responsible for final decisions and ethical judgment. The _epistemological_ question (how knowledge is constructed) also arises: if AI chooses courses or content, whose definition of “important knowledge” is being followed? Ensuring diverse input into the AI’s design and keeping humans in control helps address this.
### How do these interventions address the issues students are having?
The start of every good build is a steady, secure foundation, with these tools, students have the ability to generate, highlight and interact with scheduling, making each inefficacies transparent for the student as it may give note to bottlenecks, programmatically or interpersonally. It has been shown that a personalized plan or schedule provides structure, balance and reduces stress due to the overall improvement of time management, reducing a students of deadline pileup. Even though these recommendations are made by LLMs students are empowered by the ability to make evidence based choices that promote stronger more favorable recommendations 

## Benefits and Challenges

- **For Students:**
- _Benefits:_ AI planning brings clarity and personalization. Students gain a clear roadmap of courses and tasks, reducing anxiety about what to take or do next. Conflict-free, data-driven schedules allow more efficient time management (for study, work, extracurriculars) AI can also surface opportunities (electives, internships) aligned to a student’s interests and strengths. Importantly, AI can monitor progress and recommend interventions (e.g. suggesting tutoring if a required course is failed). Studies have shown AI advisories can boost engagement; one UNESCO report notes automating administrative tasks lets educators focus on personalized teaching, raising student engagement by up to 30%
 - _Challenges:_ Reliance on AI risks deskilling: if students don’t learn planning themselves, they may lose self-regulatory skills. There are fairness issues: AI must not favor certain students (e.g. by background). Privacy is paramount – student data used in planning must be protected. There's also a digital divide; not all students have equal access to AI-driven services, so equitable deployment is needed Finally, students may mistrust opaque AI recommendations, underscoring the need for transparency and ability to override suggestions.
- **For Faculty:**
- _Benefits:_ Faculty save time on administrative tasks. Automated scheduling relieves the burden of hand-tweaking timetables; planning assistants can suggest optimal division of sections, labs and office hours. Workload analytics (as in Ad Astra’s dashboard) help balance teaching loads and make data-driven staffing decisions. In research, AI tools can outline project management plans, helping PIs track milestones. This efficiency lets faculty spend more time on teaching and research. Additionally, AI can facilitate collaboration: by matching research interests, scheduling joint meetings, or aligning co-advising tasks.
- _Challenges:_ Faculty must trust AI outputs. If a scheduling algorithm makes a suboptimal assignment, faculty need a clear way to correct it. There is also apprehension about job impacts (though planning tools aim to assist rather than replace human roles). Learning to use new AI platforms can require training. Pedagogically, instructors may worry about students using AI for too much (e.g. letting AI do all planning), so guidelines and oversight are needed. Finally, data quality matters: faculty data must be accurate and integrated for AI to work well (e.g. up-to-date availability, accurate skill profiles).
- **For Institutions:**
- _Benefits:_ Administrators gain optimized resource allocation. AI can dramatically improve schedule efficiency: one example institution cut scheduling conflicts by 85% and increased classroom utilization by 30% after adopting AI planning. Data-driven planning means fewer over- or under-staffed courses, saving costs. Predictive analytics (as used at Georgia State University) can identify at-risk students early, improving retention (Georgia State’s alert system reportedly tracks behavior daily to connect students with advisors before issues escalate). Overall, well-implemented AI planning can lead to higher graduation rates and better student outcomes.
- _Challenges:_ Deploying AI systems has upfront costs and complexity. Institutions must invest in infrastructure and staff training. Data silos are a problem – integrating disparate systems (registrar, HR, learning management) is hard. Ethically, universities must establish policies for AI use: ensuring algorithms are fair and transparent, guarding against bias in admissions or advising, and protecting sensitive information Administrators also must manage expectations; AI planning will not be perfect and will need human oversight.

**Tools, Techniques, and Frameworks**
For final project planning, general AI assistants (ChatGPT, Bard) are being co-opted; for example, educators at Harvard have prototyped using ChatGPT as a “AI Sandbox” to help design student projects.

**Planning Algorithms and Techniques:** AI planning uses both classical search-based methods and modern ML approaches. Key techniques include:

- _Goal-Based (Classical) Planning:_ Define start state, goal state(s), and actions (with preconditions/effects). Planners search for an action sequence. PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language) is widely used to encode such problems. For educational planning, one might model “student has completed courses A,B; goal is to finish degree requirements” and let a planner output required courses in order. Algorithms like GraphPlan, Fast Downward (heuristic search), or SATPlan are examples of goal-based planners (though often used in research). These methods guarantee correctness with respect to the model, which is crucial for complex curricula.

- _Constraint Satisfaction (Scheduling):_ Many educational scheduling tasks are formulated as Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs). For instance, assigning classes to timeslots and rooms under faculty availability constraints is a CSP. Constraint Programming solvers (e.g. Google OR-Tools, IBM CPLEX) propagate “global constraints” (like room capacity or no-conflicts) and use backtracking/search to find feasible schedules Tutorials note that constraint-based scheduling explicitly separates “constraint propagation” (pruning invalid assignments) from “search strategies” (how to choose variable assignments) making it a powerful framework for timetable optimization.

- _Hybrid & ML Methods:_ Recent systems combine classical planning with machine learning. For example, TRACE-cs uses symbolic logic for hard constraints but leverages an LLM to generate human-friendly explanations. In other domains, researchers have experimented with Reinforcement Learning (RL) plus optimization to build schedules; one study in Air Force pilot scheduling applied a neural network with RL and linear programming to optimize training schedules In educational recommendations, collaborative filtering or decision-tree models predict which courses fit a student, rather than explicit planning.

- _Adaptive/Case-based Planning:_ Some e-learning systems use case-based planners or dynamic replanning: if a student deviates (fails an exam), the system “repairs” the plan by inserting remedial actions This resembles automated planning with partial observability and re-planning, a growing research area.

### Data collection Plan

These interventions should allow the collection of Qualitative by measuring the efficiency of scheduling with these tools, possibly with the percentage of conflict-free schedules or the amount of time saved to be used valuably else where. It could also be possible to establish a milestone completion rate system which at each milestone engagement metrics such as time on task or tool interaction frequency could be monitored. Finally the most accurate indicator i would say, academic performance and the overall quality of projects being created.

Along with this data, Quantitative data must also be collected this could be through surveys, possibly on the usability of tools and engagements with them. Personal interviews on time subjects who saved time or their teaching/learning methodologies have improved or being impacted, and more importantly discussions between focus groups which can help improve trust and ethical concerns allowing the impact of this project to be effectively measured.

## Impact Measurement

The perspective impact of these interventions should be comprised of comparisons of engagement, performance, project quality and success rates, initial preintervention, through possible surveys and interviews which will assist in the visualization of perceptions of Agentic tool learning space. Each tool should have suggested analytics which log data, recommendations and acceptance rates measuring the efficacy.
## Analysis Plan
It would be beneficial, to assist users and educators through the use of analysis on engagement patterns, academic performance and assess any possible improvements on completion rates of FYP Students which would intern allow for the evaluation of time saved for faculty. This along with recommendations on changes of teaching practice may allow for tool efficacy to be compared to intended outcomes when comparing expected results and actual results overall, while highlighting transparency and fairness.

## Expected outcomes
Highlighting these problems, it may be probable that software developed using agentic tools have the ability, with proper implementation, to successfully increase student engagement. By personalizing planning and student information acquisition with hopes to improve academic performance and FYP Success rates by efficiently enhancing student and faculty efficiency while reducing administrative burdens. These tools along with many other tools could be implemented to deploy sustainable change through scalable transparent agentic AI Tools.

### Generalization of these tools for Future Projects
This intervention model with successful implementation could be adapted rapidly, easily and scalable to other disciplines or institutions, which would allow these tools to be applied to different academic programs, projects and scenarios. Generalization of these tools could promote the assistance of scaling data collection for larger cohorts and inform its findings to institutional policy makers to promote the adaptation of this intervention.
