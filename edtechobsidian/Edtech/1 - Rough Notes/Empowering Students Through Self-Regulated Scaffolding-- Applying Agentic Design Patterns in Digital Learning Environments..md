***Abstract***
Educational tools enable educators and student to regulate learning outcomes through structured adaptive frameworks which actively enhance digital learning environments. Agentic Design Patterns (ADP) can be applied to learning modules which distinctively offer advantages over traditional agent design approaches. These patterns provide reusable, well-tested solutions that foster consistency by enhancing software maintainability, while also reducing the time to apply strategies for learner support mechanisms.

In contrast, systems that lack design patterns often become fragmented, unpredictable and unmaintainable for student which undermines the agency of structured student software design as a whole. This design-based approach to pedagogical software development assists with the application of adaptive research methodologies which interactively evaluate ADP-informed scaffolds to be used by groups of students engaging within digital environments completing learning objectives. 

Data Sources on the topic generally cover interaction logs, self-regulated measures and qualitative learning reflections, these findings along with this research are expected to yield proposed validation techniques to support self-regulated learning through the application of these agentic design principles by leveraging their structure to enhance student agency.
