## 🧭 Integrated Theoretical Frameworks

### Primary Theoretical Foundations

1. **Cognitive Load Theory**
    - Analytical methods (e.g., separation of variables) impose high intrinsic load due to mathematical complexity.
    - Numerical methods (e.g., Euler’s) reduce load by discretizing problems into iterative steps.
2. **Constructivist Learning Theory**
    - Hands-on exercises (e.g., MATLAB plotting) foster active problem-solving.
    - Real-world examples (e.g., Shroud of Turin dating) contextualize abstract concepts.
3. **Mathematical Modeling**
    - Differential equations as models of change (e.g., radioactive decay) bridge theory and application.
    - Numerical approximations trade precision for computational feasibility.

### Interdisciplinary Theoretical Intersections

- **Computational Science**: Numerical methods leverage algorithmic thinking.
- **Physics Education**: Applications like carbon dating ground math in physical phenomena.
- **Pedagogical Design**: Stepwise methods (Euler, RK4) scaffold learning progression.

3. **Contextual Environmental Mapping**
    - Real-world problems (e.g., carbon-14 decay with y(5370)=0.5y(0) y(5370) = 0.5y(0) y(5370)=0.5y(0)).

### Advanced Analytical Techniques

- Euler’s method: Linear approximation with step size h=b−aM h = \frac{b-a}{M} h=Mb−a​.
- Runge-Kutta (RK4): Fourth-order method with error O(h4) O(h^4) O(h4), using weighted averages.
