## Summary

This systematic review evaluates the effectiveness of blended learning (BL) in English language classrooms, focusing on metacognitive strategies and multimodal tools from 2010 to 2021. Analyzing 25 quantitative studies using PRISMA and Cochrane guidelines, the authors find BL enhances learner autonomy, engagement, and language proficiency. Metacognitive strategies (e.g., self-regulation, reflection) and tools like MOODLE and Prezi boost attention, academic achievement, and motivation. The study, conducted by researchers at VIT University, India, highlights BL’s reliance on strategic implementation, offering insights into its impact on English language teaching (ELT).

## Key Findings

- **Effectiveness:** BL improves attention, engagement, academic achievement, and language skills (Delialioglu, 2011; Kummin & Rahman, 2010).
- **Metacognitive Strategies:** Enhance cognition, self-regulation, and reflection, with significant impact on proficiency (Jaleel & Premachandran, 2016).
- **Multimodal Tools:** Tools like WebQuest and Telegram increase engagement and provide novel learning experiences (Xerri, 2012; Wahyuni, 2018).
- **Quantitative Evidence:** Mean Difference (MD) analysis shows consistent improvement across studies (e.g., MD = 27.07, Kim & Yoon, 2014).

## Methodology

- **Design:** Systematic review of 25 quantitative studies (2010–2021) using PRISMA and Cochrane guidelines.
- **Selection:** PICOS framework (Population: English learners; Intervention: BL with metacognitive strategies/tools; Comparison: traditional methods; Outcome: learning gains; Design: quantitative).
- **Sources:** Databases (e.g., ERIC, Scopus) and Google Scholar; search terms included "blended learning" and "metacognition."
- **Analysis:** Mean Difference (MD) calculated to assess effectiveness; data tabulated for participants, means, and standard deviations.

## Concepts

- **Blended Learning (BL):** Combines offline teaching with technology-mediated instruction (Husamah, 2014).
- **Metacognition:** "Thinking about thinking," fostering self-awareness and autonomy (Jaleel & Premachandran, 2016).
- **Multimodal Tools:** Digital platforms (e.g., MOODLE, Prezi) enhancing engagement and comprehension (Madhavi & Lakshmi, 2016).
- **Learner Autonomy:** BL’s capacity to empower students through flexible, interactive learning (Oh & Park, 2009).

## Notes

- **Strengths:** Rigorous methodology; broad scope (11 years); statistical validation via MD.
- **Limitations:** Excludes pre-2010 studies and non-English contexts; lacks qualitative depth.
- **Insight:** BL’s success hinges on strategic tool use and metacognitive training, not just technology adoption.
