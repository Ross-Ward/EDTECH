## Summary

This longitudinal natural experiment compared the development of narrative composition skills in Norwegian first-graders (N=181) taught to write either by handwriting (N=90) or typing on digital tablets with text-to-speech (TTS) support (N=91). Over eight months (Nov 2018–Jun 2019), students completed five narrative tasks in their respective modalities. Bayesian modeling assessed growth in text features (e.g., length, spelling, syntax, narrative sophistication). Both groups improved similarly in compositional skills (e.g., syntactic complexity, narrative structure), with no modality effect on learning rate. Digital writers started with better spelling and spacing (likely due to TTS) but showed no growth, while handwriting students improved in these areas.

## Key Findings

- **Growth Patterns:** Strong improvement over time in text length (Est. 8.28 words/time), syntactic complexity (10.84), event count (8.43), and narrative sophistication (25.15 for story grammar) (BF > 100 for linear/quadratic terms; Table 4).
- **Modality Effects:**
    - No difference in compositional learning rate (e.g., syntactic complexity BF_null = 3.6–4.8; event count BF_null = 0.92–4.8).
    - Spelling accuracy higher in digital condition (Est. 0.71 vs. 0.30 growth in handwriting; BF = 3.14), but no improvement over time (BF = 6.9 for interaction).
    - Spacing (Est. 0.94 digital vs. 0.24 growth handwriting; BF = 46) and terminator accuracy (0.81 vs. 0.12; BF > 100) better in digital condition, static over time.
- **Vocabulary Sophistication:** No growth or modality effect (Est. 6.86, BF < 3).
- **Figure 1:** Growth curves similar across modalities for compositional measures, divergent for transcription (spelling, spacing).

## Methodology

- **Design:** Natural experiment, 10 Norwegian classrooms (5 handwriting, 5 digital), 2018–2019 school year.
- **Participants:** 181 first-graders (mean age ~6.1 years), rural/semi-rural, Nynorsk language.
- **Procedure:** Five narrative tasks (6–8-week intervals), picture prompts, assessed in taught modality (handwriting: pencil/paper; digital: tablets with TTS).
- **Measures:** Text length, spelling/spacing/terminator accuracy, syntactic complexity, narrative features (events, advanced structures, story grammar).
- **Analysis:** Bayesian multivariate mixed-effects models, quadratic time effect, random slopes/intercepts for students and classrooms, data at [https://osf.io/j7ne3/](https://osf.io/j7ne3/).

## Concepts

- **Written Composition:** Ideation, syntax, and transcription processes forming coherent text.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Audio feedback of typed text, aiding error detection.
- **Bayesian Modeling:** Probabilistic inference for robust null and effect conclusions.

## Notes

- **Strengths:** Longitudinal design, real classroom context, Bayesian approach affirms null effects.
- **Limitations:** No control over teaching methods, potential fidelity issues, short-term focus (1 year).
- **Implications:** Modality choice (handwriting vs. typing+TTS) does not inherently affect composition learning rate in year 1; TTS boosts initial transcription accuracy.
- **Future Research:** Long-term effects, reading development, modality transitions.
