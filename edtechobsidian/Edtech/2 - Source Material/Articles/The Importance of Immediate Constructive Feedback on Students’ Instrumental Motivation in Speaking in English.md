🎯 Core Research Question  
Investigate the potential and limitations of Generative AI in [[academic-journal-article-creation|academic journal article creation]], specifically in synthesizing and analyzing the relationship between immediate constructive feedback and students’ instrumental motivation in speaking English, as explored in Entika and Ling’s study.

🧭 Theoretical Framework  
[[technology-acceptance-model|Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)]]

- Examines technological integration in academic contexts
- Provides an analytical lens for understanding AI’s role in educational research on feedback and motivation

🚀 Generative AI Capabilities  
💪 Strengths

- Efficient synthesis of research findings (e.g., summarizing feedback and motivation links)
- [[research-idea-generation|Research idea generation]] (e.g., connecting feedback to employability)
- Structured content creation (e.g., organizing literature review and results)
- Rapid production of academic prose (e.g., drafting discussion sections)
- Support for quantitative analysis presentation (e.g., interpreting correlation data)

🚧 Limitations

- Inconsistent response quality (e.g., potential oversimplification of statistical nuances)
- Potential logical inconsistencies (e.g., misinterpreting weak correlations)
- [[citation-management-challenges|Unreliable citation management]] (e.g., risk of misattributing sources)
- Risk of omitting critical experiential context (e.g., students’ cultural perspectives)

🔬 Prompt Engineering Strategies  
Key Components

- Deep content knowledge integration (e.g., understanding motivation theories)
- [[critical-thinking-in-ai|Critical thinking application]] (e.g., evaluating feedback’s impact)
- Iterative design methodology (e.g., refining prompts for precise analysis)

Practical Techniques

- Continuous context reminders (e.g., specifying English-speaking focus)
- Systematic variable preservation (e.g., retaining instrumental motivation focus)
- Incremental refinement requests (e.g., detailing statistical interpretations)
- Cross-verification of generated content (e.g., checking regression data accuracy)

⚖️ Ethical and Scholarly Considerations  
🌟 Opportunities
