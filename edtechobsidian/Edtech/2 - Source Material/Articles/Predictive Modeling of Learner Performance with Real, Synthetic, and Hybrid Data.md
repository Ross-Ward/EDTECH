## 💡 Synthesized Key Insights

The study shows hybrid datasets (real + synthetic) outperform real (330 records) and synthetic (5,000 records) datasets alone, with SVR achieving 87.76% accuracy on hybrid data. Diverse feature sets (P1–P5) reduce RMSE (e.g., 12.17 for quad sets), confirming RQ1. Synthetic data via ACTGAN matches real data utility (RQ2), offering a privacy-compliant alternative. Limitations include regional specificity and potential synthetic data gaps.

## 🖋️ Reflective Discourse

### Critical Reflection

Hybrid datasets enhance predictive power, but their reliance on synthetic data raises questions about authenticity. The 87.76% accuracy is promising, yet scalability and generalizability need broader testing beyond Karnataka.

### Epistemological Meditation

How do we define "truth" in predictive modeling when synthetic data blurs the line between real and constructed? This challenges traditional notions of evidence in education, urging a rethinking of data’s role in knowledge creation.
