## Summary

This Delphi study explores attentional literacy (AL) in digital higher education, addressing the challenges of hyperconnectivity and digital disarray. It refines AL’s definition through expert input from contemplative pedagogy (CP) practitioners and outlines strategies for educators and students to cultivate AL, enhancing focus and agency in online learning environments.

## Key Findings

- **AL Definition:** Ability to notice, focus, sustain attention, remain open to perspectives, and consider the attentional ecosystem.
- **Educator Role:** Develop personal AL holistically before guiding students.
- **Student Development:** Progress through awareness, focus, openness, and ecosystem awareness.
- **Barriers:** Time pressure, institutional constraints, and digital distractions.
- **Benefits:** Improved focus, critical thinking, empathy, and learning outcomes.

## Methodology

- **Design:** Three-round qualitative-dominant Delphi study.
- **Data:** Surveys with global CP educators (n=7 initially, n=6 completed).
- **Approach:** Iterative consensus-building on AL definition and practices.

## Concepts

- **Attentional Literacy (AL):** Intentional attention management in digital contexts.
- **Contemplative Pedagogy (CP):** Mindfulness-based practices fostering awareness and focus.
- **Hyperconnectivity:** Constant digital availability impacting attention.

## Notes

- Emphasizes AL as a skill and attitude over knowledge.
- Practical “essential” AL definition aids classroom application.
- Calls for institutional support to reduce time pressure.
