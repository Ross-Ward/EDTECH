**Summary:**  
Kate Exley, from the University of Leeds, argues that while lectures remain a cornerstone of higher education despite criticism for fostering student passivity, their value can be enhanced through active learning strategies. This article explores the benefits of interactivity in large group settings, addressing challenges to traditional lecturer and student roles. Exley advocates for varied stimulation (auditory, visual, physical) and practical techniques (e.g., quizzes, peer discussions, clickers) to boost engagement, comprehension, and retention. She concludes that interactive lectures can secure their future relevance by offering "added value" beyond passive note-taking.

**Key Findings:**

- **Lecture Critique:** Passivity linked to surface learning; yet, lectures persist due to scale and face-to-face value (Section 1).
- **Active Learning Benefits:** Enhances comprehension, memory retention, and motivation; counters attention lapses after 10-20 minutes (Section 2).
- **Stimulation Types:** Auditory (voice variation), visual (slides, videos), and physical (tasks) improve engagement (Section 2).
- **Practical Strategies:** Quizzes, peer discussions, and tech tools (e.g., clickers, SMS) foster participation (Sections 3-4).
- **Challenges:** Shifts in lecturer control and student expectations require careful planning (Sections 3-5).

**Methodology:**

- **Design:** Theoretical argument supported by literature and practical examples.
- **Approach:** Examines lecture critiques, benefits of interactivity, and implementation strategies.
- **Evidence:** Cites studies on attention (Johnstone & Percival, 1976), memory (Broadbent, 1970), and tech use (Draper et al., 2002).
- **Perspective:** Draws from Exley’s experience in educational development.

**Concepts:**

- **Active Learning:** Student participation in tasks to deepen understanding (Section 2).
- **Large Group Teaching:** Lectures for many students; traditionally passive (Section 1).
- **Interactivity:** Engaging students via questions, discussions, or tech (Sections 2-4).
- **Lecture Stimulation:** Varying delivery to sustain attention (Section 2).
- **Educational Technology:** Tools like clickers enhance feedback (Section 4).

**Notes:**

- **Strengths:** Practical, scalable ideas (e.g., “three things to do” per hour) with research backing (Section 2).
- **Limitations:** Assumes lecturer willingness to adapt; tech costs noted as barriers (Section 4).
- **Insight:** Interactivity reframes lectures as dynamic learning spaces, not just content delivery (Section 5).
