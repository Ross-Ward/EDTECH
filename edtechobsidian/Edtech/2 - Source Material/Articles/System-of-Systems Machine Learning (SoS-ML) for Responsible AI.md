## 💡 Synthesized Key Insights

Shamsuddin et al. (2025) propose SoS-ML, a modular, multi-agent framework for explainable AI (XAI), integrating cognitive and social science insights. Tested on the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset (80% accuracy) and Pie Chart Interpreter (e.g., 88.46% A2-A3 selection for 10-slice charts), SoS-ML enhances accuracy, context-awareness, and explainability over traditional XAI (e.g., LIME, SHAP). Its phased approach—multi-agent (Phase 1), system control (Phase 2), and scalability (Phase 3)—offers a blueprint for responsible AI in high-stakes domains like healthcare and justice.

## 🖋️ Reflective Discourse

### Critical Reflection

SoS-ML’s modularity promises transparency but risks computational overhead. Balancing scalability with interpretability remains a key challenge for real-world adoption.

### Epistemological Meditation

What defines a “responsible” explanation? SoS-ML’s evidence-inference model suggests a hybrid of causal and social reasoning, challenging purely computational paradigms.
