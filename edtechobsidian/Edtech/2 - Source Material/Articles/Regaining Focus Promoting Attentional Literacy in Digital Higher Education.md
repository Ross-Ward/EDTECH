## Summary

This Delphi study explores attentional literacy (AL) in digital higher education, addressing the challenges of hyperconnectivity and digital disarray. Conducted with a global panel of contemplative pedagogy (CP) practitioners, it refines a definition of AL and proposes strategies for its integration into online curricula. AL is defined as the ability to notice, focus, sustain attention, remain open to perspectives, and consider the attentional ecosystem. Findings emphasize educators developing their own AL holistically before guiding students through stages of awareness, focus, openness, and ecosystem awareness. Despite institutional barriers like time pressure, AL enhances agency over attention, improving digital learning outcomes.

## Key Findings

- **AL Definition:** Validated and refined through three Delphi rounds into a full multifaceted version and an essential, operationalizable version (Table 6):
    - Full: Ability to notice attention solicitation, focus intentionally, sustain attention, remain non-judgmental, and consider the attentional ecosystem.
    - Essential: Notice and understand attention solicitation, focus and sustain attention, remain open to perspectives, consider ecosystem impact.
- **Educator Strategies:** Top-ranked include attending to student-teacher-content interactions (Rank 1) and supporting students’ attentional needs (Rank 2) (Table 1).
- **Student Competencies:** Top include focused reading (Rank 1) and being comfortable alone with thoughts (Rank 2-9) (Table 3).
- **Teaching Strategies:** Relating AL to students’ lives (Rank 1) and teaching intentional attention (Rank 2) lead (Table 4).
- **Advantages:** Improved focus (Rank 1) and deeper learning engagement (Rank 2-6) (Table 5).
- **Barriers:** Time constraints and lack of institutional support; mitigated by experiential, CP-integrated approaches.

## Methodology

- **Participants:** 7 CP educators (initially 8, 1 dropout) from diverse global backgrounds (North America, Europe, Asia), with 2+ years online teaching experience.
- **Method:** Three-round qualitative-dominant Delphi process:
    - Round 1: Open-ended questions on AL definition and practices.
    - Round 2: Ranking strategies, competencies, and barriers.
    - Round 3: Consensus on definition and categorization (personal/pedagogical/PD).
- **Data Collection:** Online surveys via research.net over 7 months in 2023.

## Concepts

- **Attentional Literacy (AL):** Ability to manage attention intentionally in digital contexts, blending digital literacies and CP.
- **Contemplative Pedagogy (CP):** Cultivates awareness and presence through practices like meditation and reflection.
- **Hyperconnectivity:** Constant availability via digital channels, leading to distraction and disarray.
- **Digital Disarray:** Distraction, disorder (misinformation), and disconnection in online environments.

## Notes

- Builds on Pegrum & Palalas (2021), emphasizing AL’s role in countering digital overwhelm.
- Limitation: Small sample size (7-6 panellists) due to specialized expertise.
- Practical Insight: Start with educator AL development, then guide students sequentially through AL stages.
- Future Research: Test AL in broader educator groups and diverse cultural contexts.
