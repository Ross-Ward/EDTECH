## Summary
This experimental study investigates how online collaboration impacts writing performance in flipped learning environments. Conducted with 178 graduate students in a flipped English scientific writing course at a South Korean university, it compares three conditions: a control group with no online collaboration, a treatment group using online discussion forums, and another using collaborative note-taking via Google Docs. Results indicate that both collaborative methods significantly enhance individual writing scores compared to the control, with forums also improving group writing scores. Rooted in social constructivism, the study underscores the importance of student-to-student interaction in bridging online and offline components of flipped courses.

## Key Findings
- **Individual Writing Performance:** 
  - Control: 37.6 (SD 4.91)
  - Forums: 40.7 (SD 4.63)
  - Note-taking: 40.3 (SD 5.12)
  - Significant difference (Kruskal-Wallis, p = 0.00213); forums and note-taking outperform control (Dunn test, p.adj < 0.05), no significant difference between forums and note-taking.
- **Group Writing Performance:** 
  - Control: 27.7 (SD 4.00)
  - Forums: 28.4 (SD 6.45)
  - Note-taking: 28.0 (SD 5.14)
  - Significant difference (Kruskal-Wallis, p = 0.03716); forums outperform control (Dunn test, p.adj = 0.032), note-taking does not.
- **Implications:** Online collaboration enhances learning outcomes by fostering connections between course components. Forums may encourage deeper idea exchange, aiding group work more than note-taking.

## Methodology
- **Participants:** 178 graduate students (34 female, 144 male, mean age 27) in STEM fields.
- **Conditions:** 
  - Control (n=60): No required online collaboration.
  - Forums (n=58): 3+ weekly posts required (20% grade incentive), 1904 posts total.
  - Note-taking (n=60): Collaborative notes in small groups via Google Docs, 1 point/week for participation.
- **Measures:** Individual writing (5 assignments, max 50 points), group writing (4 assignments, max 36 points).

## Concepts
- **Flipped Learning:** Online pre-class learning (e.g., videos) paired with in-class collaboration.
- **Social Constructivism:** Knowledge is co-constructed through social interaction (Vygotsky, 1978).
- **Collaborative Writing:** Co-authoring texts enhances understanding and critical thinking.

## Notes
- Aligns with prior studies (e.g., Cheng et al., 2011; Orndorff, 2015) showing collaboration boosts writing skills.
- Limitation: Lacks data on collaboration quality or social equity barriers.
- Practical Insight: Instructors should integrate online collaborative tools to maximize flipped learning benefits.
