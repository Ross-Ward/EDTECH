🎯 Core Research Question  
Investigate the potential and limitations of Generative AI in [[academic-journal-article-creation|academic journal article creation]], specifically in co-creating a comparative book review of _The Alignment Problem_ (Christian, 2020) and _God, Human, Animal, Machine_ (O'Gieblyn, 2021) for educational scholarship.

🧭 Theoretical Framework  
[[technology-acceptance-model|Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)]]

- Examines technological integration in academic contexts
- Provides an analytical lens for understanding AI’s role as a collaborative partner in scholarly writing

🚀 Generative AI Capabilities  
💪 Strengths

- Efficient synthesis of book content (e.g., summarizing core ideas from Christian and O'Gieblyn)
- [[research-idea-generation|Research idea generation]] (e.g., connecting AI themes to education)
- Structured content creation (e.g., adhering to a review outline)
- Rapid production of coherent, academic-toned prose
- Responsiveness to iterative human feedback

🚧 Limitations

- Inconsistent response quality (e.g., initial errors in author names and word counts)
- Potential logical inconsistencies (e.g., fabricated details in early drafts)
- Lack of personal judgment and positionality (e.g., detached tone despite “I” usage)
- Risk of omitting critical experiential depth due to absent human interiority

🔬 Prompt Engineering Strategies  
Key Components

- Deep content knowledge integration (e.g., authors’ familiarity with AI and education)
- [[critical-thinking-in-ai|Critical thinking application]] (e.g., refining prompts iteratively)
- Iterative design methodology (e.g., multiple dialogue sessions over 3 hours)

Practical Techniques

- Continuous context reminders (e.g., specifying academic tone and themes)
- Systematic variable preservation (e.g., maintaining focus on AI and education)
- Incremental refinement requests (e.g., testing and adjusting prompts)
- Cross-verification of generated content (e.g., checking thematic accuracy)
