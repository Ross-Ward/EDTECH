- Structured content creation (e.g., organizing findings by themes)
- Rapid production of academic prose (e.g., drafting discussion sections)
- Support for conceptual analysis (e.g., interpreting Whitchurch’s typologies)

🚧 Limitations

- Inconsistent response quality (e.g., potential oversimplification of identity complexities)
- Potential logical inconsistencies (e.g., missing nuanced institutional tensions)
- [[citation-management-challenges|Unreliable citation management]] (e.g., risk of misreferencing sources)
- Risk of omitting critical experiential depth (e.g., specific Irish university context)

🔬 Prompt Engineering Strategies  
Key Components

- Deep content knowledge integration (e.g., understanding third-space theory)
- [[critical-thinking-in-ai|Critical thinking application]] (e.g., evaluating role legitimacy)
- Iterative design methodology (e.g., refining prompts for contextual accuracy)

Practical Techniques
