## Summary

The study investigates how university students perceive AI educational technologies (AIEd) and how this impacts their course satisfaction. Despite moderate comfort with AIEd, students reported a decline in projected course satisfaction when imagining these technologies in use — especially for grading and well-being support. The study highlights the role of general attitudes toward AI and the mediating effect of comfortableness with AI applications.

## Key Findings

- **Student Comfort:** Students were moderately comfortable with AIEd overall (M = 3.32/5), but comfort dropped significantly for applications involving grading, admissions decisions, or emotional support.
    
- **Satisfaction Impact:** Course satisfaction declined with hypothetical AIEd adoption, except when AI was framed as enhancing learning technologies.
    
- **Attitude Effects:** Positive and negative general attitudes toward AI (measured via GAAIS) predicted satisfaction differences, mediated by comfort levels with specific AI applications.
    
- **Preferred AIEd Uses:** Students favored administrative, career, and formative learning support AI over evaluative or well-being functions.
    
- **Trust and Transparency:** Concerns over data privacy, trustworthiness, and perceived loss of human judgment reduced comfort with high-stakes AIEd (e.g., grading).
    

## Methodology

- **Participants:** 302 UK university students (64.9% undergrad, 15.9% taught master’s).
    
- **Measures:** Course satisfaction survey (NSS-based), GAAIS for AI attitudes, comfort scale for 15 AIEd applications.
    
- **Analysis:** Regression and mediation modeling to test how AI attitudes predict satisfaction changes, mediated by comfort with AIEd.
    

## Concepts

- **AI Educational Technologies (AIEd):** AI systems designed to automate, support, or enhance teaching, learning, and administrative tasks.
    
- **General Attitudes Towards Artificial Intelligence Scale (GAAIS):** A validated tool measuring positive (utility, excitement) and negative (unethical uses, fear) AI perceptions.
    
- **Comfortableness:** Defined as a sense of ease and emotional acceptance of AI applications.
    

## Notes

- AIEd is more accepted for support functions than evaluative or emotional roles.
    
- Trust and transparency are critical for high-stakes AIEd adoption.
    
- Institutional AI adoption strategies should consider student attitudes to avoid drops in satisfaction.
