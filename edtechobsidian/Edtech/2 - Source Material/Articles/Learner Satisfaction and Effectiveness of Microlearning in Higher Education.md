## Summary

This study examines learner satisfaction and the effectiveness of microlearning within a business education context, focusing on a case study of MicroMaster (MM), a Spanish EdTech startup founded in 2017. Microlearning—short, focused learning units delivered via mobile devices or platforms—is increasingly popular, yet its impact on academic outcomes and satisfaction remains underexplored. Using a qualitative narrative inquiry approach, the authors analyze MM’s programs, which transition from microlearning to macro-learning (sequenced modules forming broader curricula). Findings indicate high satisfaction due to flexibility and accessibility, with effectiveness tied to learners’ intrinsic and extrinsic motivations. The study highlights microlearning’s potential to reach non-traditional students and its implications for higher education and professional development.

## Key Findings

- **Satisfaction:** MM programs received high satisfaction ratings, attributed to flexibility, accessibility, and well-structured content, aligning with prior research (e.g., >90% satisfaction in Wang et al., 2021).
- **Effectiveness:** Learning outcomes varied by motivation—intrinsic (e.g., curiosity) yielded mixed results (knowledge vs. entertainment), while extrinsic (e.g., career goals) consistently updated skills.
- **Micro-to-Macro Transition:** Sequenced microlearning units formed effective macro-learning pathways, appealing to learners deterred by traditional postgraduate commitments.

## ## Methodology

- **Approach:** Qualitative narrative inquiry via a single case study (MicroMaster).
- **Case Selection:** MM, an EdTech startup with 90,000 alumni, 600 client companies, and a presence in 103 countries, chosen for its pioneering success.
- **Data Collection:** Likely interviews or surveys with MM participants (details truncated; inferred from narrative inquiry norms).
- **Analysis:** Thematic analysis of subjective experiences, focusing on satisfaction and perceived effectiveness (specific methods unclear due to OCR truncation).
- **Ethics:** Informed consent obtained; study complied with institutional ethical standards.
## Concepts

- **Microlearning:** Short, focused learning bursts (e.g., via mobile devices, chatbots) reducing cognitive load and enhancing flexibility (Taylor & Hung, 2022).
- **Macro-learning:** Aggregated microlearning units forming a cohesive curriculum, addressing systemic topics (Zhang & West, 2020).
- **Learner Satisfaction:** High acceptance linked to autonomy, brevity, and alignment with informal learning cultures (e.g., YouTube-style consumption).
- **Learning Effectiveness:** Impact on knowledge/skill acquisition, influenced by motivation and instructional design.

## Notes

- **Strengths:** Pioneering case study, practical insights for EdTech and higher education, bridges micro- and macro-learning.
- **Limitations:** Single case limits generalizability; truncated methodology/results hinder full evaluation; lacks quantitative outcome measures.
- **Insight:** Microlearning’s appeal to non-traditional learners suggests a shift in educational models, though effectiveness requires motivational alignment.

- [[Microlearning]]
    - **Subnote:** Defined as brief, targeted learning units delivered “just-in-time” (Corbeil & Corbeil, 2022), leveraging mobile devices and chatbots (Taylor & Hung, 2022). Reduces cognitive load and suits limited attention spans (Sun et al., 2016). MM case shows high satisfaction and variable effectiveness. Connects to [[LearnerSatisfaction]] for acceptance drivers and [[LearningEffectiveness]] for outcome variance.
- [[MacroLearning]]
    - **Subnote:** Sequences microlearning into broader curricula (Zhang & West, 2020), addressing systemic topics absent in standalone microlearning (Taylor & Hung, 2022). MM’s success suggests potential for long-term learning pathways. Links to [[Microlearning]] for foundational units and [[HigherEducation]] for curriculum implications.
- [[LearnerSatisfaction]]
    - **Subnote:** High in microlearning due to flexibility, autonomy, and cultural fit (e.g., TikTok-style learning; Konde-Cannille, 2023). MM findings align with prior studies (>90% satisfaction; Wang et al., 2021). Driven by perceived choice/value (Yin et al., 2021). Connects to [[Microlearning]] and [[StudentMotivation]].
- [[LearningEffectiveness]]
    - **Subnote:** Measures knowledge/skill gains; MM links effectiveness to motivation (intrinsic vs. extrinsic). Under-researched in microlearning (Carter & Youssef-Morgan, 2022); MM suggests macro-learning enhances outcomes. Links to [[Microlearning]] and [[StudentMotivation]] for causal factors.
- [[HigherEducation]]
    - **Subnote:** Microlearning challenges traditional models, offering accessible alternatives (Rof et al., 2022a). MM targets non-traditional learners, prompting innovation in postgraduate education. Connects to [[EdTech]] and [[MacroLearning]] for structural shifts.
 [[EdTech]]
    - **Subnote:** MM exemplifies EdTech’s role in scaling microlearning (90,000 alumni, 103 countries). Drives educational consumerism (King, 2021) and business model innovation (Mujica-Lana et al., 2021). Links to [[Microlearning]] and [[HigherEducation]].
- **Future Question:** How does macro-learning’s effectiveness compare to traditional curricula in diverse fields beyond business?
