**Summary:**  
This article by Aodán Farrelly, a University of British Columbia educator, reflects on using ChatGPT-3.5, HIX.AI, and Perplexity to craft a 2600-word report on Hybrid and HyFlex teaching models. Leveraging his prior MA research, Farrelly posed eight prompts to explore naming conventions, student implications, and teaching strategies. The resulting AI-generated report, "Understanding the Nuances of Hybrid and HyFlex Teaching," clarifies distinctions, addresses confusion, and offers practical advice. Reflections highlight GenAI’s competence with structured prompting but emphasize the need for prior knowledge to evaluate outputs, noting limitations like shallow depth and subscription-based disparities.

**Key Findings:**

- **Hybrid vs. HyFlex:** Hybrid synchronizes in-person and online learning with fixed schedules; HyFlex offers student-driven flexibility (Section 2.2).
- **Naming Confusion:** Interchangeable use of Hybrid, blended, and HyFlex terms causes student uncertainty and inconsistent experiences (Section 2.3).
- **Student Implications:** Unclear conventions lead to planning difficulties, tech readiness issues, and reduced satisfaction (Section 2.3).
- **Teaching Strategies:** Flexibility, tech proficiency, and engagement tools ensure equivalence across modalities (Sections 2.5, 2.6).
- **GenAI Performance:** Produced articulate content (~11,400 words total, refined to 2600) but required curation and prior expertise for coherence (Section 3).

**Methodology:**

- **Design:** Reflective narrative using three GenAI tools (ChatGPT-3.5, HIX.AI, Perplexity) to generate a report over six days.
- **Prompts:** Eight sequential queries (Section 1.3) on definitions, implications, and strategies, with references requested for prompts 5-8.
- **Process:** Generated text stitched together from multiple platforms (C, H, P markers); intro/conclusion added via ChatGPT; titles selected from AI suggestions.
- **Tools:** Free versions used; ChatGPT dominant, supplemented by Perplexity (reference-focused) and HIX.AI (ChatGPT-based).

**Concepts:**

- **Generative AI:** Tools like ChatGPT create content but vary in transparency and depth (Section 3).
- **Hybrid Learning:** Synchronous blend of in-person and online instruction (Section 2.2).
- **HyFlex Learning:** Flexible model prioritizing student choice in participation mode (Section 2.2).
- **Naming Conventions:** Clarity in terminology shapes expectations and outcomes (Section 2.3).
- **Educational Equivalence:** Ensuring consistent experiences across learning modalities (Section 2.6).

**Notes:**

- **Strengths:** Quick generation, accurate references (e.g., Perplexity’s numbered links), and articulate prose (Section 3.2).
- **Limitations:** Bullet-point style, repetition (e.g., “in summary”), shallow analysis, and subscription barriers (Section 3).
- **Insight:** GenAI excels with structured prompts and expert oversight but lacks standalone scholarly depth (Section 3.3).
