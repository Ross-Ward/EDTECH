🎯 Core Research Question  
Investigate the potential and limitations of Generative AI in [[academic-journal-article-creation|academic journal article creation]], specifically in synthesizing and analyzing the need for educational innovation to address Ireland’s psychologist shortage, as explored in Szproch et al.’s position paper.

🧭 Theoretical Framework  
[[technology-acceptance-model|Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)]]

- Examines technological integration in educational contexts
- Provides an analytical lens for understanding AI’s role in researching psychology training solutions

🚀 Generative AI Capabilities  
💪 Strengths

- Efficient synthesis of policy arguments (e.g., summarizing workforce shortage data)
- [[research-idea-generation|Research idea generation]] (e.g., linking blended learning to inclusivity)
- Structured content creation (e.g., organizing barriers and solutions)
- Rapid production of academic prose (e.g., drafting sections on educational innovation)
- Support for multilingual contexts (e.g., aiding Irish researchers with global references)

🚧 Limitations

- Inconsistent response quality (e.g., potential oversimplification of systemic barriers)
- Potential logical inconsistencies (e.g., missing interplay of government funding and training)
- [[citation-management-challenges|Unreliable citation management]] (e.g., risk of misreferencing sources)
- Risk of omitting critical socio-cultural depth (e.g., Irish-specific diversity issues)

🔬 Prompt Engineering Strategies  
Key Components

- Deep content knowledge integration (e.g., understanding PSI accreditation)
- [[critical-thinking-in-ai|Critical thinking application]] (e.g., evaluating training accessibility)
- Iterative design methodology (e.g., refining prompts for policy relevance)

Practical Techniques

- Continuous context reminders (e.g., specifying Irish mental health crisis)
- Systematic variable preservation (e.g., retaining focus on blended learning)
- Incremental refinement requests (e.g., detailing online education benefits)
- Cross-verification of generated content (e.g., checking alignment with UK workforce plan)
