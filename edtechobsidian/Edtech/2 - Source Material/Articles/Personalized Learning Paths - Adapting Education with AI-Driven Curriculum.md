## Summary
This review paper explores how AI-driven personalized learning paths transform education by tailoring curricula to individual needs. Synthesizing literature, it finds that AI enhances academic performance, engagement, and retention across diverse learners. Grounded in cognitive psychology and AI algorithms, it highlights adaptability, continuous assessment, and inclusivity as key strengths, while addressing ethical challenges like privacy and bias.

## Key Findings
- **Effectiveness:** AI curricula improve understanding and retention vs. traditional methods.
- **Adaptability:** Caters to diverse learning styles (visual, auditory, kinesthetic).
- **Engagement:** Boosts motivation and satisfaction through personalization.
- **Customization:** Tailors content to individual proficiency and pace.
- **Assessment:** Continuous feedback enhances learning trajectories.
- **Inclusivity:** Reduces disparities by supporting varied needs.

## Methodology
- **Design:** Systematic literature review.
- **Sources:** PubMed, IEEE Xplore, ERIC, Google Scholar (last 10 years).
- **Criteria:** Peer-reviewed studies on AI-driven personalized learning in formal education.

## Concepts
- **Personalized Learning:** Custom education based on individual traits.
- **Adaptive Systems:** AI adjusts content, pace, and assessments dynamically.
- **Cognitive Psychology:** Aligns learning with cognitive styles.

## Notes
- Supports shift from one-size-fits-all education.
- Ethical concerns: privacy, bias need addressing.
- Practical implication: AI aids resource efficiency and policy insights.
