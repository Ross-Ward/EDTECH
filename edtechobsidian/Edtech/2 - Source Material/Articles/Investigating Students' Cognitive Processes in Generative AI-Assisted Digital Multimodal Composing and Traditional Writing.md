## Summary

This qualitative study examines the cognitive processes of eight Chinese international undergraduate EFL students in New Zealand over two weeks, comparing generative AI-assisted digital multimodal composing (PowerPoint, PPT) with traditional argumentative essay writing. Using screen recordings with think-aloud protocols, final texts, and post-project interviews, the study finds distinct text production patterns: the PPT group constructed more bridge texts and examples hierarchically and borrowed summarized Bing Chat results, while the essay group expanded content with online sources. For image creation, the PPT group used ChatGPT descriptions as prompts for Bing Image Creator, optimizing and evaluating images based on relevance, reasonability, prior knowledge, audience interaction, and style preferences. The study highlights generative AI’s role in supporting multimodal writing without compromising linguistic focus.

## Key Findings

- **Text Production Differences:**
    - PPT group: More bridge texts and examples in hierarchical order; direct borrowing from Bing Chat summaries.
    - Essay group: Deeper expansion using cited online sources from Bing Chat.
- **Image Creation (PPT Group):**
    - Process: ChatGPT descriptions as prompts, Bing Image Creator generation, optimization per recommendations, evaluation via five criteria (relevance, reasonability, prior knowledge, interaction effectiveness, style).
    - Example: Cindy preferred cyberpunk over cartoon styles for audience engagement (Fig. 17).
- **Implications:** Multimodal composing with AI enhances text production and visual design without detracting from language focus; AI images boost engagement but require critical evaluation.

## Methodology

- **Participants:** 8 Chinese EFL undergrads (IELTS 6.0–7.0), mean age 22.75, varied majors (Table 1).
- **Design:** Two groups (4 each): PPT (multimodal, 15+ slides) vs. Essay (traditional, 1000+ words) on "AI-enhanced future society."
- **Tools:** ChatGPT (text generation), Bing Chat (search/text), Bing Image Creator (images), ChatGPT-prompt-generator, Quillbot (paraphrasing), Grammarly (editing).
- **Procedure:** 5-step process over 2 weeks: draft/outline generation, selection via Grammarly scores, content expansion, paraphrasing, final evaluation.
- **Data:** Screen recordings with think-alouds, final texts (Word/PPT), semi-structured interviews.
- **Analysis:** Qualitative, based on cognitive model of multimodal writing (Hayes, 2012; Leijten et al., 2014).

## Concepts

- **Generative AI:** AI tools (ChatGPT, Bing Chat, Bing Image Creator) producing text/images from prompts.
- **Digital Multimodal Composing:** Creating meaning with text, visuals, and other semiotic modes.
- **Cognitive Processes:** Mental activities (searching, proposing, translating, transcribing, evaluating) in writing.
- **Think-Aloud Protocols:** Verbalizing thoughts during tasks to reveal cognitive processes.

## Notes

- **Strengths:** Rich qualitative data, real-time cognitive insights, practical AI integration.
- **Limitations:** Small sample (n=8), voluntary recruitment, no quantitative measures, short duration.
- **Insight:** AI supports efficiency and creativity but risks over-reliance; critical thinking remains essential.

- [[CognitiveModelOfWriting]]
    - **Subnote:** Based on Hayes (2012), writing involves control (goals), process (internal/external factors), and resource (memory, attention) levels. Leijten et al. (2014) adapt this for multimodal composing, adding Searcher, Proposer, Translator, Transcriber, and Evaluator components. This study extends it to AI-assisted contexts, showing how tools like ChatGPT aid the Proposer and Translator stages. Links to [[CognitiveProcessesInWriting]] for broader implications.
- [[GenerativeAIToolsInEducation]]
    - **Subnote:** Encompasses ChatGPT (text generation), Bing Chat (search-enhanced text), and Bing Image Creator (text-to-image via DALL·E 2). These tools personalize learning, as seen in students’ iterative drafting and image optimization. Risks include dependency (Yilmaz & Yilmaz, 2023b) and bias (Dale, 2017). Connects to [[AIInLanguageLearning]] for EFL applications.
- [[DigitalMultimodalComposing]]
    - **Subnote:** Involves integrating text, images, and other modes (Lim & Kessler, 2023). This study shows PPT students balancing linguistic and visual tasks, supporting Kim et al. (2023) on language focus retention. Contrasts with [[TraditionalWriting]] where cognitive load focuses solely on text. Links to [[Multiliteracies]] for broader literacy gains.
- [[TraditionalWriting]]
    - **Subnote:** Defined as text-only composition (e.g., essays), emphasizing linguistic depth (Kang & Kim, 2023). Here, essay students used AI for content expansion, differing from PPT’s succinctness. Challenges include potential neglect of non-linguistic skills (Qu, 2017). Connects to [[CognitiveProcessesInWriting]] for process comparison.
- [[ImageGenerationInMultimodalWriting]]
    - **Subnote:** Uses ChatGPT prompts and Bing Image Creator (DALL·E 2-powered) to create visuals, evaluated by relevance, reasonability, etc. Students’ style adjustments (e.g., Cindy’s cyberpunk preference) reflect critical engagement. Ties to [[SocialSemiotics]] for visual meaning-making and [[GenerativeAIToolsInEducation]] for tech context.
- **Future Question:** How do long-term AI-assisted multimodal projects impact writing skill retention?
