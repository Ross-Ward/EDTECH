Below is a new Markdown (.md) note for your Zettelkasten, crafted using the provided "Comprehensive Educational Technology Research Framework" template. This note is based on the research article by An et al. (2025) about Generative AI (GenAI) guidelines in U.S. higher education institutions. I’ve adapted the template’s structure and strategies to maximize linkage, incorporate tags for connectivity, and reflect the content of the document while aligning with Zettelkasten principles (e.g., atomicity, interlinking, and future expandability).

## 🖋️ Reflective Discourse

### Critical Reflection

This research underscores the tension between GenAI’s transformative potential and its ethical risks (#EthicalReflection). The reliance on faculty to set policies suggests a decentralized approach, but the lack of guidelines for researchers and staff indicates gaps in institutional readiness (#ImplementationGaps). Future work should explore how these policies shape student outcomes (#PedagogicalImpact).

### Epistemological Meditation

GenAI challenges traditional notions of originality and knowledge production (#Epistemology). As AI mediates learning, how do we redefine academic integrity in a collaborative, technology-driven era? (#KnowledgeCreation)
