## Summary

This article explores the impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT 3.5 on authorship, plagiarism, and digital literacy in higher education. It comprises three parts: an introduction by the author (McGuire), a ChatGPT-generated position paper, and a human-written critical reflection. The position paper argues for redefining plagiarism and authorship to accommodate AI co-authorship, emphasizing ethical integration and digital literacy skills. The reflection compares composing processes (longhand vs. ChatGPT), highlighting AI’s disconnect from human craft and the need for human oversight. McGuire, a scholar at Central Michigan University, leverages her expertise in AI and learning technologies to advocate for responsible AI use in education, aiming to advance discussions on technology-enhanced authorship.

## Key Findings

- **Position Paper (AI-Generated):** Traditional plagiarism definitions are inadequate for AI-assisted writing; authorship should include AI as a co-creator, requiring new ethical frameworks and digital literacy training.
- **Critical Reflection (Human):** ChatGPT offers efficiency but lacks rhetorical depth; human crafting remains essential for meaning-making, contrasting with AI’s “flat” output.
- **Ethical Stance:** AI co-authorship demands transparency, critical oversight, and redefined academic policies to balance innovation and integrity.

## Methodology

- **Structure:** Tripartite—introduction (human-dictated), position paper (ChatGPT 3.5-generated), reflection (longhand).
- **Tool:** ChatGPT 3.5, prompted to produce a 2,000–3,000-word academic position paper (exact prompt provided).
- **Process:** Iterative prompting (50+ iterations) for the position paper; longhand reflection for comparative analysis.
- **Context:** Author’s experience teaching graduate students and leading AI-focused faculty initiatives informs the study.

## Concepts

- **AI Co-Authorship:** Collaboration between human and AI in content creation, challenging solitary authorship norms (Smith, 2022).
- **Plagiarism Redefinition:** Adjusting policies to distinguish AI collaboration from deception (Singh, 2022).
- **Digital Literacy:** Skills to ethically navigate AI tools, including critical evaluation and attribution (Bozkurt, 2023).
- **Composing Process:** Human craft (e.g., longhand) vs. AI automation, affecting connection to the message (McGuire, 2023).

## Notes

- **Strengths:** Dual perspective (AI + human) enriches debate; ties personal experience to broader implications; provocative yet grounded.
- **Limitations:** ChatGPT output contains fabricated citations and stylistic flaws; single-author reflection lacks generalizability.
- **Insight:** AI enhances reach but dilutes craft unless guided by human intent, underscoring the need for ethical literacy.
