## Summary
This practitioner paper details the development of a Graphic Facilitation Digital Badge for staff at Atlantic Technological University. It explores how graphic facilitation enhances teaching, learning, and community-building in an online Higher Education setting. Using an ADDIE design and UDL principles, the module improved engagement, communication, and wellbeing via visual strategies, despite challenges with time and technology.

## Key Findings
- **Graphicking:** Enhances communication, engagement via visuals.
- **Grappling:** Time and tech challenges in mastering skills.
- **Community:** Fosters connection, reduces online isolation.
- **Outcomes:** Improved teaching strategies, staff wellbeing.

## Methodology
- **Design:** ADDIE model, qualitative survey (Braun & Clarke, 2006 thematic analysis).
- **Participants:** 17 staff (teaching, support), 10-week pilot in 2021.
- **Tools:** E-tivities (Salmon, 2013), Gagné’s 9 events, MS Sway, Miro, Moodle.

## Concepts
- **Graphic Facilitation:** Visual strategies for learning.
- **UDL:** Inclusive design for diverse learners.
- **Community of Practice:** Shared learning enhances bonds.

## Notes
- Aligns with Dewey’s experiential learning.
- Balances benefits (engagement) with challenges (tech learning).
