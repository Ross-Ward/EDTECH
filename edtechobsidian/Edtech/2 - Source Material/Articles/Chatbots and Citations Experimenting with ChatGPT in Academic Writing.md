**Summary:**  
This article details an experiment by Dublin City University educators Enda Donlon and Peter Tiernan, who used ChatGPT-3.5 to generate an academic paper on digital natives in teacher education. Responding to a challenge to fully embrace AI, they employed iterative prompts to produce a ~2000-word report, "Born into Bytes," exploring digital native traits, educational challenges/opportunities, and innovative teaching strategies. Reflections highlight ChatGPT’s strengths (e.g., coherent drafts, credible references) and weaknesses (e.g., word count shortfalls, dated sources), emphasizing the need for precise prompting and critical AI literacy in academic writing.

**Key Findings:**

- **Digital Natives:** Characterized by tech-savviness, multitasking, and preference for interactive content; impact teacher education needs (Section 2).
- **Challenges:** Short attention spans, information overload, and digital distractions complicate teaching (Section 2, Challenges and Opportunities).
- **Opportunities:** Digital fluency and collaboration enable innovative, tech-rich learning (Section 2, Challenges and Opportunities).
- **ChatGPT Performance:** Produced credible content swiftly (~10 minutes post-prompting) but fell short of word targets (1200 vs. 2000-2500) and used dated references (Section 3).
- **Implications:** AI excels at drafting components (e.g., intros, conclusions) but requires human oversight for depth and accuracy (Section 3, Conclusion).

**Methodology:**

- **Design:** Experiment using ChatGPT-3.5 (free version) to write a paper in October 2023, followed by reflection.
- **Prompts:** Evolved from a single request (2000-2500 words) to nine scaffolded prompts (Section 1, Process and Prompts) for iterative refinement.
- **Process:** 90 minutes total; 10 minutes for generation after prompt planning, with manual compilation and minor edits.
- **Tool:** ChatGPT-3.5 chosen for prominence and accessibility; limited to pre-September 2021 data.

**Concepts:**

- **Generative AI:** ChatGPT generates text for academic tasks, balancing utility and limitations (Section 1).
- **Digital Natives:** Tech-native generation reshaping education (Prensky, 2001; Section 2).
- **Teacher Education:** Must adapt via tech integration and personalized learning for digital natives (Section 2, Innovative Approaches).
- **Prompt Engineering:** Precise prompts enhance AI output quality (Section 3, Quality Considerations).
- **Critical AI Literacy:** Essential for navigating AI’s academic potential and pitfalls (Section 3, Conclusion).

**Notes:**

- **Strengths:** Error-free writing, relevant references (e.g., Prensky, 2001; Bennett et al., 2008), and effective intros/conclusions (Section 3).
- **Limitations:** Word count deficits, dated sources (pre-2021), missing bibliography entries (e.g., Graham, 2013), and lack of critique unless prompted (Section 3).
- **Insight:** ChatGPT accelerates drafting but demands strategic prompting and manual refinement for scholarly rigor (Section 3).
