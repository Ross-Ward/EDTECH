## Summary

This survey-based study investigates how the hypothetical adoption of AI educational (AIEd) technologies affects university students’ course satisfaction and comfort levels. Using the General Attitudes towards Artificial Intelligence Scale (GAAIS), it finds that while AIEd offers potential benefits, students generally expect reduced course satisfaction due to discomfort with technologies replacing human judgment, alongside concerns about privacy, transparency, and trust.

## Key Findings

- **Satisfaction Impact:** Hypothetical AIEd adoption lowers projected course satisfaction overall (H1 supported).
- **GAAIS Predictive Power:** Positive and negative attitudes toward AI (via GAAIS) predict satisfaction differences (H2 supported) and comfortableness with AIEd (H3 supported).
- **Mediation Effect:** Comfortableness mediates the relationship between GAAIS scores and satisfaction differences (H4 supported).
- **Comfort Variability:** Students are more comfortable with AI for data-driven tasks (e.g., analytics) than human-judgment tasks (e.g., grading, counseling).
- **Risks and Concerns:** Privacy, transparency, bias, and lack of autonomy reduce trust and acceptance.

## Methodology

- **Design:** Survey method with inferential statistics testing four hypotheses.
- **Data:** 302 UK university students recruited via Prolific; measured baseline satisfaction, projected satisfaction with AIEd, and comfortableness with specific AIEd applications.
- **Tools:** GAAIS (positive and negative subscales) to assess AI attitudes; ethical approval from School of Psychology Ethics Committee (Code: PR050522).
- **Approach:** Examined direct and mediated effects of attitudes on outcomes.

## Concepts

- **AI Educational Technologies (AIEd):** Tools like chatbots, intelligent tutoring systems, and automated grading enhancing education.
- **Technology Acceptance:** Student willingness to adopt AIEd, influenced by trust and autonomy.
- **Course Satisfaction:** Perceived quality of educational experience, impacted by technology integration.
- **Comfortableness:** Degree of ease with AIEd, tied to application type and perceived risks.

## Notes

- AIEd’s transformative potential is tempered by student resistance to human-like functions.
- Negative GAAIS scores strongly correlate with larger satisfaction drops, highlighting ethical and transparency concerns.
- Suggests careful AIEd implementation to mitigate risks and enhance acceptance.

### Notes on the Process

- The OCR text had significant repetition and errors (e.g., "Rochergy" instead of "Rodway," "Sclapessan" instead of "Schepman"), which I corrected based on context and the article title.
- Some sections (e.g., results beyond page 9) were incomplete due to truncation, so I focused on the abstract, introduction, methods, and partial discussion to construct the note.
- The "Future Question" and links are inferred from the study’s implications and align with prior notes you’ve requested.
