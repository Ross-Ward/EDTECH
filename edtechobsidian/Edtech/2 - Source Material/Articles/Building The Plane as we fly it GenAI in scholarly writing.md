**Summary:**  
This article investigates the use of Perplexity, a Generative AI (GenAI) tool, to generate scholarly content on the effects of inadequate online teacher training on teaching, cognitive, and social presence in university online courses, framed by the Community of Inquiry (CoI) model. Triggered by the COVID-19 shift to online learning, the authors—educators at Deree - The American College of Greece and The American Community Schools of Athens—experimented with Perplexity’s free version. The AI-generated report highlights training deficits’ negative impacts on CoI presences but falls short of scholarly depth. Reflections reveal Perplexity’s speed and relevance alongside limitations like shallow analysis and inaccurate references, advocating for Critical AI Literacy and refined prompting strategies to enhance future scholarly use.

**Key Findings:**

- **Teaching Presence:** Lack of training reduces interaction, course design quality, and feedback, weakening facilitation within CoI (Section 2.2).
- **Cognitive Presence:** Untrained faculty struggle to foster reflection and dialogue, hindering knowledge construction (Section 2.3).
- **Social Presence:** Absence of training limits community-building, though its impact may be overstated (Section 2.4).
- **Perplexity Performance:** Generated ~500 words against a 2000-2500 word target; swift (under 10 seconds) but superficial with reference errors (Section 3.1).
- **Implications:** GenAI democratizes knowledge access but requires human oversight and Critical AI Literacy for ethical, effective use (Section 3.2).

**Methodology:**

- **Design:** Action research using Perplexity to produce a manuscript on online training deficits, analyzed via CoI framework.
- **Prompts:** Eleven sequential prompts (Section 1.5) tailored to teaching, cognitive, and social presences, with iterative refinements.
- **Tool:** Perplexity (free version), chosen for research orientation and source transparency.
- **Reflection:** Authors compared individual outputs for accuracy and coherence, stitching them into a unified report with minor edits (Section 3.1).

**Concepts:**

- **Generative AI:** Tools like Perplexity generate text, aiding scholarship but risking bias and superficiality (Section 1.1).
- **Community of Inquiry (CoI):** Framework of teaching, cognitive, and social presences for effective online learning (Section 2.1.2).
- **Online Teacher Training:** Essential for adapting to digital pedagogy, especially post-COVID (Section 2.1.1).
- **Critical AI Literacy:** Skill to critically evaluate AI outputs, ensuring ethical integration (Section 3.2).

**Notes:**

- **Strengths:** Rapid response, relevant CoI insights, and resource identification (Section 3.1).
- **Limitations:** Short output, missing seminal works (e.g., Garrison et al.), non-APA references, and COVID-heavy focus (Section 3.1).
- **Insight:** GenAI accelerates drafting but demands rigorous human refinement for scholarly rigor, highlighting the need for strategic prompting (Section 3.1).
