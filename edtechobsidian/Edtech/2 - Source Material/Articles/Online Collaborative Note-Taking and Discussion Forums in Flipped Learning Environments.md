## Summary
This experimental study investigates how online collaboration impacts writing performance in flipped learning environments. Conducted with 178 graduate students in a flipped English scientific writing course in South Korea, it compares three conditions: no online collaboration (control), online discussion forums, and collaborative note-taking via Google Docs. Both collaborative methods significantly enhance individual writing scores compared to the control, with forums also improving group writing scores.

## Key Findings
- **Individual Writing:** Control (37.6), Forums (40.7), Note-taking (40.3); significant (p = 0.00213).
- **Group Writing:** Control (27.7), Forums (28.4), Note-taking (28.0); forums beat control (p = 0.03716).
- **Implications:** Collaboration bridges online-offline gaps, forums deepen idea exchange.

## Methodology
- **Participants:** 178 STEM graduate students, mean age 27.
- **Conditions:** Control (n=60), Forums (n=58, 1904 posts), Note-taking (n=60, Google Docs).
- **Measures:** Individual writing (max 50), group writing (max 36).

## Concepts
- **Flipped Learning:** Online prep, in-class collaboration.
- **Social Constructivism:** Knowledge via interaction.
- **Collaborative Writing:** Co-creation enhances skills.

## Notes
- Supports prior research (e.g., Cheng et al., 2011).
- Limitation: No data on collaboration quality.
