## 🎯 Multidimensional Research Inquiry

### Core Research Question

How can numerical methods be taught to solve systems of differential equations (e.g., Lotka-Volterra), boundary value problems (BVPs), and parabolic PDEs (e.g., heat equation) in an educational context?

### Nested Research Sub-Questions

1. **Cognitive Dimension**: How do students conceptualize the interplay of predator-prey dynamics, steady-state solutions, and time-dependent phenomena?
2. **Technological Intervention**: What role do computational techniques (e.g., finite differences, Newton’s method) play in approximating solutions?
3. **Learning Ecosystem Impact**: How do applied examples (e.g., temperature distribution, population dynamics) enhance comprehension?

## 🧭 Integrated Theoretical Frameworks

### Primary Theoretical Foundations

1. **Dynamical Systems Theory**
    - Lotka-Volterra models predator-prey interactions as coupled ODEs.
    - Numerical solutions reveal oscillatory behavior without analytical complexity.
2. **Cognitive Load Theory**
    - Finite difference methods simplify BVPs by discretizing derivatives, reducing intrinsic load.
    - Stepwise processes (e.g., Newton’s method) scaffold nonlinear problem-solving.
3. **Heat Transfer Physics**
    - Parabolic PDEs (e.g., heat equation) model diffusion, grounding math in physical intuition.
    - Boundary and initial conditions anchor numerical approximations.

### Interdisciplinary Theoretical Intersections

- **Ecology**: Lotka-Volterra as a biological model.
- **Computational Science**: Finite differences and Newton’s method as algorithmic tools.
- **Pedagogical Design**: Examples (e.g., metal rod temperature) bridge theory and application.

### Research Methodology Spectrum

- Pedagogical exposition via examples and step-by-step derivations.
- Covers ODE systems (Lotka-Volterra), BVPs (linear/nonlinear), and PDEs (heat equation).
- No formal empirical study; instructional intent assumed.

### Data Collection Strategies

1. **Cognitive Assessment Protocols**
    - Exercises solving Lotka-Volterra, BVPs (e.g., u′′−u=2x u'' - u = 2x u′′−u=2x), and heat equation setups.
2. **Technological Interaction Mapping**
    - Vector approximations for p(t) p(t) p(t) and y(t) y(t) y(t) in predator-prey systems.
    - MATLAB-like pseudocode for initial guesses (e.g., y[i]=0.5x[i] y[i] = 0.5x[i] y[i]=0.5x[i]).
3. **Contextual Environmental Mapping**
    - Physical examples: temperature in a rod, population dynamics.

### Advanced Analytical Techniques

- **Finite Difference Method**: Central differences (e.g., u′′(xi)≈ui+1−2ui+ui−1h2 u''(x_i) \approx \frac{u_{i+1} - 2u_i + u_{i-1}}{h^2} u′′(xi​)≈h2ui+1​−2ui​+ui−1​​) for BVPs.
