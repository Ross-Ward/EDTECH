Title: be a lifelong learner

One should strive to be a lifelong learner as there is always something to learn every day. The key is to listen and each day will present a lesson.

**But why should one commit oneself to learning?**

To expand your mind. In order to seek truth, one has to constantly learn about the world in which the inhabit. Assumptions are dangerous and can close off new information or perspectives that would challenge those assumptions.

Rather than remaining static in your comfort zone of competence, strive to be a better version of yourself. Challenge your outdated mindset constantly and see if new ideas align with your current views or if you need to update your views.

Being able to think for oneself and able to learn unaided is valuable in developing an independent mind.

**Learning for what? For the sake of learning?**

Yes. There is value in [[learning for the sake of learning]].

And one cannot grow if one doesn't learn, for how can we experience growth if we don't allow new ideas to incubate our mind?

If we're not learning, we're not updating our understanding of the world.
