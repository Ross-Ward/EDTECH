Title: pomodoro technique

A time management system that encourages people to work with the time they have rather than against it. The method consists of doing 25-minute chunks of work separated by 5-minute breaks, repeated 4 times for a net total of 2 hours of work.

These intervals are referred to as pomodoros.

1. 25 minutes of work
2. 5 minute break
3. 25 minutes of work
4. 5 minute break
5. 25 minutes of work
6. 5 minute break
7. 25 minutes of work
