Title: deep work

Deep work is a state of peak concentration that helps you learn hard things and create quality work quickly. This requires [[attention management]] so distractions don't get in the way.

Three to four hours a day, five days a week, of uninterrupted and carefully directed concentration, it turns out, can produce a lot of valuable output.
