Title: learning for the sake of learning

The lives of great thinkers teach us that learning is the verb of life.

The trick to life-long learning is to exercise your curiosity as much as you can and let it guide you wherever it wants to go.

Practice [[attention management]]. Block out distractions and focus.

Take a [[digital detox]] and put your phone away so that you can focus on the tasks in front of you that are a priority rather than deal with the distraction of notifications vibrating.
