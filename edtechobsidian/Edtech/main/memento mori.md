Title: memento mori

Latin phrase that means "remember that you must die (someday)."

It's a reminder of the inescapability of death. It's not intended to be morbid- rather to clarify, illuminate, and inspire.

> *"You can leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say and think."*
> -- Marcus Aurelius
