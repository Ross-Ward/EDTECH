Title: evergreen notes

This note is an **Evergreen Note**.

Similar to permanent notes from a [[zettelkasten]] system.

Evergreen notes are a fundamental unit of knowledge work. They're a way to build up a personal library of clear opinions, beliefs and original thoughts.

- Evergreen notes should be [[atomic idea]] notes
- Evergreen notes should be concept-oriented
- Evergreen notes should be densely linked

In contrast to Evergreen notes, most people use notes as a bucket for storage or scratch thoughts. These are very convenient to write, but after a year of writing such notes, they’ll just have a pile of dissociated notes. The notes won’t have *added up* to anything: they’re more like fuel, written and discarded to help the author process their ongoing experiences.

==Essentially, an evergreen note is a continuously evolving document that is densely linked with other ideas.==

Based and evolved from the [[zettelkasten method]] where [[zettel]]s are hyperlinked to one continuous, evolving document. In this way, zettels can still be written and linked to other zettels, but the permanent documents would be evergreen notes referencing other notes.
