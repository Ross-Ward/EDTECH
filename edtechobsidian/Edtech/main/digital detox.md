Title: digital detox

The voluntary and intentional abstinence from technology use.

Traces back to ideals from [[stoicism]] in that one should voluntarily allow themselves to feel discomfort and by putting ourselves in uncomfortable situations we'll realize that we *can* deal with them. We are much more powerful than we imagine ourselves to be, but we limit our abilities when we remain in comfort.

Eliminating tv, computers, and phones for a few days has been shown to improve non-verbal communication skills and enhance mental wellbeing.
