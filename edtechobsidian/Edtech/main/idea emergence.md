Title: idea emergence

**Emergence Level 1:** From "nothingness" of a fleeting thought to something concrete. It's what's beneath the surface of anything externalized.

**Emergence Level 2:** Here notes start to link to other notes. Simple, basic zettelkasten. The more notes there are, the more the system comes alive. This is a well oiled zettelkasten.

**Emergence Level 3:** Index notes or Maps of Content (MOCs) to act as bird's eye view of note relationships. These are essentially higher level notes and are simply notes with links to other notes.

**Emergence Level 4:** MOCs are linked to other MOCs. Instead of living systems (zettelkasten), you now have living ecosystems. Allows you to go through your notes rapidly and organically.

**Emergence Level 5:** The HOME note. It consolidates new higher-level order notes with older higher-level notes. The Home note is the beginning and end, the launchpad and homebase. The Home note allows for top-down convergent thinking like navigating and deliberately creating. It also allows for bottom-top convergent thinking by consolidating new forms of emergence.
