Title: stoicism

The goal of stoicism is to attain inner peace by developing self-control in being aware of our impulses and realizing that life is ephemeral. This philosophy holds that a clear and unbiased thinker allows one to see the world as it is rather than react emotionally.

Being a stoic is being calm in any situation. You don't show you you're feeling and you accept reality as it is.
