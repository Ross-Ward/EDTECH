Title: reasoning by first principles

 Sometimes called “reasoning from first principles,” the idea is to break down complicated problems into [[atomic idea]]s and then reassemble them from the ground up. It’s one of the best ways to learn to think for yourself, unlock your creative potential, and move from linear to non-linear results. 
 
 A first principle is a foundational proposition or assumption that stands alone. We cannot deduce first principles from any other proposition or assumption. In other words, an [[axiom]].
 
 Reasoning by first principles removes the impurity of assumptions and conventions. What remains is the essentials. It’s one of the best mental models you can use to improve your thinking because the essentials allow you to see where [[reasoning by analogy]] might lead you astray.
 
 The difference between reasoning by first principles and reasoning by analogy is like the difference between being a chef and being a cook. If the cook lost the recipe, he’d be screwed. The chef, on the other hand, understands the flavor profiles and combinations at such a fundamental level that he doesn’t even use a recipe. He has real knowledge as opposed to know-how. The chef is demonstrating [[mastery]] as well in this case.
