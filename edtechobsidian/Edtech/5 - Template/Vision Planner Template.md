## My Vision

*Start with What do you want and Why 5+.* What do you want to do? Why? Why to that answer? Why to *that* answer? Why to *that* answer? Why to *that* answer? This line of questioning will get to the bottom of what you truly want. And once you know why, you'll have your how.

You may find that your vision changes as you get older. That's okay! Tweak your vision, or duplicate your prior vision and rename it to archive it and link it to your current vision.
